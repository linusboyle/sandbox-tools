1d100	森林遭遇
1	队伍遇到一位贵族，他正试图获取狮鹫蛋。他打算利用队伍作为母狮鹫的诱饵，以便自己接近巢穴并偷取几枚蛋。新生的狮鹫将成为贵族儿子的坐骑。 The party comes across a noble, who is trying to get his hands on some gryffin eggs. He want to use party as bait for mother, so he will be able to approach the nest and sneak some eggs out. The newborn gryffon will be a mount for the son of the nobleman.
2	森林本身似乎对你的存在充满敌意。树根突然冒出绊倒你，树枝在拨开时拍打你。树冠在你周围合拢，遮蔽了阳光。 The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.
3	你发现一座隐士小屋，床上躺着一位已故的老人。他的獒犬正需要一位新主人。 You find an old hermit hut with the dead man still in his bed. His mastiff needs a new master.
4	在森林小径旁，你偶然发现一片空地和一个被改造成路警哨所的小洞穴。篝火正旺，食物在煮，但此地却空无一人。空地上遍布足迹，延伸入林，其中一些绝非人类所留。细查之下，你在洞内发现一间小牢房，所有牢门紧锁且空置，唯有一间从内部被强行打开。 Just off the forest road you stumble across a clearing and a small cave that have been converted into a road wardens outpost. You find the fire burning and food cooking but the place is deserted. There are tracks all over the clearing and heading into the forest, including some that definitely aren’t human. After closer inspection you find a small lockup inside the cave, the cells are all locked and empty except for one that has been forced open from the inside.
5	一副空荡荡的板甲伫立着，锈迹斑斑。它手中握着一把伐木斧，仍保持着凶狠的下劈姿势。 An empty suit of plate armour stands rusted solid. In it’s hands are a woodsman’s axe, still posed in a vicious downward stroke.
6	清晨时分，队伍经过一套悬挂在树间的盔甲，树枝填满了盔甲内部，仿佛挤出了原先占据其中的躯体。面罩上疯狂地长出枝条，腿部和臂部的孔洞中伸出肢体，整个胸甲几乎被茂密的枝叶撑爆。 Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.
7	队伍遇到一只被巨型蜘蛛网困住的哥布林。如果玩家靠近，哥布林会挣脱束缚，与蜘蛛一起以德鲁伊的身份发动攻击。原来这是一个陷阱！ The party comes across a goblin trapped in a giant spider’s web. If the players approach, the goblin untangles himself and attacks as a Druid alongside the spiders. It was a set-up!
8	当队伍经过一棵横跨道路的大橡树下时，一根树枝猛然垂下，抢走了其中一名成员的背包。当你们试图取回时，这棵树显得口头上任性，将背包在树枝间抛来抛去。 As the party passes beneath a large oak that has grown over the road, a branch swoops down and snatches the backpack from one of your group. The tree proves vocally petulant when you attempt retrieval, tossing the bag from one branch to another.
9	在前方的路上，队伍听到一群哥布林在为方向争吵。其中一个在大喊大叫，另一个拿着地图，看起来十分沮丧。他们还没注意到队伍。 On the path up ahead, the party hears a group of goblins arguing over directions. One of them is screaming and the another is holding a map, looking frustrated. They haven’t noticed the party yet.
10	有人在树林中哭泣：一个男人坐在岩石上，双手抱头，手肘支在膝盖上。他是一位尝试了禁忌仪式的巫师。他的头掉了下来，但他没有死，也不感到疼痛。只要他扶住头部，伤口几乎看不出来。他希望得到帮助，但又害怕你们和他自己变成的样子。 Someone’s crying in the woods: a man sitting on a rock holding his head with both his hands, elbows resting on his knees. He’s a wizard who tried a forbidden ritual. His head fell off, but he didn’t die, and feels no pain. The wound is barely noticeable—as long as he holds his head in place. He’d like help, but fears you and what he’s become.
11	当玩家们在不安的露营夜后清晨醒来，发现周围的泥土上布满了脚印。他们的背包被翻动过，但什么也没被偷走。这种情况连续几晚重复发生。 When your players awake in the morning after a restless night of camping, they discover footprints all around them in the dirt. Their backpacks have been looked through, but nothing has been stolen. This happens a few more nights in a row.
12	浓稠的雾气弥漫至该区域，你几乎看不清前方五步之遥。当你经过时，模糊的球状物从树中凸出可见。真菌。这不是雾气，而是孢子。 Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn’t mist, it’s spores.
13	浓雾迅速且异常浓厚地弥漫开来，所有与地形相关的导航或调查检定均处于劣势。 A deep fog rolls in faster and thicker than one would think is natural. All rolls related to navigation or investigation based on the terrain have disadvantage.
14	队伍遇到三名带着十二只大型獒犬（受过训练的护卫犬）的旅人。他们训练并繁殖这些犬只，四处旅行售卖。他们愿意以每只20金币的优惠价格出售。 The party runs into three men travelling with a dozen big mastiffs (trained wardogs). They train and breed them and travel from place to place, selling them. They are willing to sell them at the greatly discounted price of 20gp each.
15	路旁有一座森林之神的小神龛。神龛由一英尺厚的木墙构成，上方有小型屋顶，墙上突出一个麋鹿的木雕。墙上钉着几张写有祈祷文的羊皮纸碎片。神龛脚下摆放着各种供品：新割的谷物、鲜花、编织的手绳、男孩的木雕等。一个木碗里盛有1d6枚金币。 On the side of the road is a small shrine to a forest god. The shrine is a one-foot-thick wooden wall with a small roof over it with a wooden carving of an elk protruding from the wall. A handful of scraps of parchment bearing prayers are tacked to the wall. Various offerings lie at the foot of the shrine: Fresh cut grain, flowers, a woven cord bracelet, a wooden carving of a boy, etc. A wooden bowl contains 1d6 gold pieces.
16	你正穿行于高草丛中，突然听到一只鹰头马身兽的尖啸。它的一条腿似乎被绑在地上一具尸体上。看来有人试图驯服并捕捉这头野兽，却以失败告终。他的工具仍散落在身旁…… You are walking through the tall grass when you hear the shrieks of a hippogryph. One of its legs seems to be tied to a corpse on the ground. It would seem someone was trying to train and capture the beast and failed. His tools are still lying there with him...
17	队伍被迫躲入树林，一辆漆黑如墨的马车从相反方向疾驰而过，溅起泥浆和落叶。当他们到达下一个村庄时，得知这辆马车在过去三个月里已被目击三次，每次都是满月之夜，车夫总是像被地狱恶魔追赶般疯狂驱马。每次马车经过，村里都会有一个孩子失踪…… The party is forced to dive for the trees as a sable-black coach thunders down the road in the opposite direction, spraying them with mud and fallen leaves. When they reach the next village, they learn that the same coach has been seen three times in the last three months, always when the moon is full, the coachman always driving his horses as if the demons of hell were behind him. Each time the coach passes through, a child from the village has gone missing...
18	你穿过一片荒芜的森林区域，大约十年前这里曾遭受森林火灾的破坏。在这片相对荒凉的土地中央，你发现了一圈似乎未被大火波及的树木，与周围被毁的环境形成鲜明对比。 You past through a barren section of the forest that was damaged about a decade ago by a forest fire. In the middle of this relative desolation, you find a circle of trees that seems untouched by fire that destroyed the surroundings.
19	当队伍沿着林间小径行进时，随机选择一名玩家。这名玩家偶然发现了一条偏僻小径旁的一圈红色小蘑菇。如果玩家破坏或打扰这些蘑菇，它们会在几分钟内枯萎死亡。如果玩家在蘑菇圈中心留下一件有价值的物品，第二天醒来时，他们会发现身边多了一袋宝石。 As the party is walking along the forest path, pick one of your players at random. This player randomly spots a small ring of red mushrooms off the beaten path. If they destroy the mushrooms or disturb them, they wither and die within a few minutes. If they leave an item of worth in the center of the ring, they will wake up the next day with a bag of gems sitting next to them.
20	队伍遇到了一位名叫克里格的快乐旅行修士。他留着大胡子，头发剪得很短，缺了几颗牙，肚子也很大。他真诚友好，讨人喜欢。如果队伍同意与他分享口粮，他会为所有人祝福。 The party meets a jovial travelling friar named Krieger. He has a big beard and closely cropped hair. He is missing a couple of teeth and has a large belly. He is genuinely friendly and likeable. If they agree to share their rations with him, he will bless them all.
21	当队伍在夜晚扎营时，他们熄灭的营火突然重新燃起，熊熊燃烧。一旦守夜的队员看向火焰，它便完全熄灭。唯一证明这神秘火焰存在过的迹象，是一股淡淡的烧焦树枝的气味。 While camped for the night, the party’s extinguished campfire relights to a full blaze. The second the party member on watch looks at the fire, it extinguishes completely. The only sign that the mysterious fire ever existed is a faint smell of burning twigs.
22	一座长满青苔、摇摇欲坠的古代人类国王雕像矗立在森林小径旁。由白色石材雕成，因年代久远而斑驳，它描绘了一个被时间遗忘的失落王朝。附近树木的根系正逐渐包围这座雕像。 An overgrown and crumbling statue of a long, dead human king juts from the ground along the forest path. Built of white stone, stained with age, it depicts a lost dynasty forgotten by time. The roots of a nearby tree are beginning to surround the statue.
23	一双发光的眼睛从一棵古老扭曲的树洞中凝视着。当玩家注意到它在观察时，那东西迅速逃入树洞深处。如果他们调查树洞，会发现它深不可测，甚至比树本身还要深。在洞底，有什么东西在闪烁。是黄金吗？周围还有更多发光的眼睛向上凝视。 Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they’ll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.
24	六名骑马的巡逻员拦下所有过路者。他们正在搜寻一群邪教徒。他们会要求男性脱下上衣，展示可能有的纹身，并对所有人进行搜身。他们对任何人的纹身都格外关注，并询问是否见过可疑的人或事物。只要没有发现异常且无人拒绝他们的要求，他们就会放行。 Six mounted road wardens halt anyone passing by. They are on the lookout for a group of cultists. They will make the men remove their shirts and reveal any tattoos they might have. They then pat everyone down. They pay very close attention to any tattoos anyone has. They will ask if they have seen anyone or anything suspicious. As long as they don’t find anything and no one refuses their demands, they will let them continue on their way.
25	队伍偶然发现一座小屋前的骚动。一位看似无辜的美丽年轻女子被堵嘴绑在柱子上，一群村民声称她是女巫，正准备点燃火刑架烧死她。这名女子实际上是一只绿皮妖婆，但她会尽力在玩家面前表演，以诱使他们帮助她逃脱。 The party stumbles across a commotion in front of a small hut. A beautiful innocent looking young woman is gagged and tied to a post, a group of villagers claim she is a witch and are preparing a pyre to burn her. The woman is indeed a Green Hag, but she will try to put on a good show for the players to get them to help her escape.
26	你遇到林中一间小屋，属于一位友善的樵夫和他的妻子。他们提供食物和过夜的庇护。当队伍醒来时，他们身处一间被烧毁的小屋废墟中，樵夫和他妻子的遗骸正绝望地向队伍伸出手。 You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.
27	木烟的气味提醒你，在小溪对岸的空地上有一小群烧炭人。一座覆盖着草皮的圆锥形小屋旁，一个较小的窑炉正释放出淡蓝色的烟雾，三名男子（亨克、达比和麦多克）坐在附近吃着面包和奶酪。第四名男子（芬恩）被绑在几英尺外的树上，喃喃自语，头来回摆动。如果靠近，那三人会紧张地站起来，若被追问，他们会声称被绑的男子（麦多克的兄弟）只是身体不适。然而，一次令人信服的帮助芬恩的尝试可能会促使麦多克透露，他的兄弟被一种幻觉所困扰——那是他们燃烧的榛树枝上的猪肺真菌，让芬恩产生了幻觉，看到了一些其他人不愿听的事情，但玩家们或许会感兴趣…… The smell of wood-smoke alerts you to a small group of charcoal burners before you get sight of them in a clearing across a small brook. A conical hut clad with turf stands next to a smaller kiln which is releasing blueish tendrils of smoke, while three men (Henk, Darby, and Maddock) sit nearby eating cheese with bread. A fourth man (Fenn) is tied to a tree a few feet away, muttering and thrashing his head from side to side. If approached the three rise, apprehensively, and, if pressed will claim that the tied man (Moddock’s brother) is just unwell. However, a convincing attempt to help Fenn might prompt Maddock to reveal that his brother is gripped by a vision - it’s the swinelung fungus on the hazel bundles that they burn, it gives Fenn a turn, and he starts seeing things, things that the others don’t really want to hear about, but the players might...
28	小径旁矗立着一棵古老扭曲的树，散发着黑暗能量。若树木受损，将开始渗出一只由非自然污染孕育的怪物。 An old twisted tree sits shortly off the path. It radiates a dark energy. If the tree is damaged, it will begin to leak a monster that grows from unnatural pollution.
29	六棵巨大的树人正聚集在一个石圈周围。他们注意到了玩家，但并未多加理会。 A group of six massive treants are congregating around a stone circle. They notice the players, but pay them no mind.
30	队伍遇到一座桥，由一名全身笼罩在黑色板甲中的孤独战士守卫，铠甲上刻有邪神的标记。战士向队伍提出一个简单的挑战：他们杀死他，便可过桥；他杀死他们，则将他们的头颅加入身旁那堆不祥的巨大颅骨堆中。 The party comes across a bridge, guarded by a lone warrior clad in all concealing black plate armor, bearing the marks of an evil god. The warrior gives the party a simple challange: They slay him, they cross the bridge. He slays them, he adds their skulls to the ominously large skull pile next to him.
31	队伍遇到一个衣衫褴褛的人类，他坚称自己是地精战酋格鲁姆布克，因犯下滔天罪行而被变成了可憎的人类。他执意要讲述自己多次袭击人类定居点的恐怖故事，并恳求队伍将他交给当局处置。 The party encounters a ragged human in ragged clothes. He insists that he is the goblin warchief Grumbl’buk and that he has done terrible things, resulting in him getting transformed into a disgusting human. He insists on confessing the tales of his many horrible raids against human settlements. He begs them to take him to the authorities and turn him in.
32	森林小径狭窄且杂草丛生。望向那隧道般的路径让你感到眩晕，失去平衡。阴影似乎在移动，你感觉自己只是在原地打转。 The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.
33	你遇到一棵装饰着肠子、悬挂着鲜红人心和小燃烧蜡烛的冷杉树。树下有几个用彩纸包裹的小盒子。 You come across a fir tree garlanded with intestines and hung with bright red human hearts and small burning candles. Under the tree are a number of small boxes wrapped in colorful paper.
34	路障处有三名道路守卫把守。前方一英里处有一座小镇，因黄热病疫情而被隔离。道路守卫会解释一条迂回路线，只会增加大约一天的行程。 There is a roadblock manned by three road wardens. A mile up the road there is a small town infected with the yellow plague. It has been quarantined. The road wardens will explain a circuitous route that will only add a day or so to their travel.
35	一小群兽人和地精正在赌一只狗头人与蛇的搏斗。铜币和银币被随意抛掷，场面愈发激烈。他们喧闹的欢呼和对小战斗的专注，或许能让你悄悄接近、绕过他们……或是设下埋伏。 A small group of Orcs and Goblins are betting on a fight between a kobold and a Snake. Copper and Silver coins are being tossed about with reckless abandon as things continue to get heated. Their raucous cheering and focus on the small battle could allow you sneak up on them, go past them... or set up an ambush.
36	在离小径约一百码处，玩家们发现了一道峡谷。风吹过时发出诡异的呼啸声。峡谷顶端有一座破旧的小屋，它向峡谷倾斜，峡谷两侧的树木也全都如此。 About a hundred yards off the path, the players spot a ravine. The wind makes an eerie howling sound as it blows through it. At the top of the ravine there is an old decrepit shack. It leans toward the ravine, as do all of the trees on either side of the ravine.
37	一只脾气非常暴躁的熊从荒野中冲出，袭击了玩家。 A bear with a very violent temper comes out of the wilderness and attacks the players.
38	队伍遇到一名靠在树上睡觉的男性人类，全身覆盖着蜘蛛网。看起来他已经在那里待了很长时间。显然，他在25年前与一个妖精生物的酒量比赛中败北。 The party comes across a male human sleeping against a tree, covered in cobwebs. It looks like he has been there for a LONG time. Apparently, he lost a drinking contest to a Fey creature 25 years ago.
39	队伍走进了一个“仙女圈”，一圈奇异的蘑菇。这些蘑菇被某种方式污染，释放出一团孢子，以某种方式影响队伍。可能是致幻、心理影响，或是传送到另一个地方…… The party walks into a ‘fairy ring’. A ring of odd mushrooms. These are tainted in some way which produces a cloud of spores that affect the party in some way. Psychogenic, psychologically, transport to another locale...
40	一位有点跛脚的矮人牵着一头驮满各种杂物和小玩意儿的驴子。他名叫格林德尔，会试图向玩家角色兜售各种奇怪的物品。 An old dwarf with a bit of a limp is leading a donkey that is overladen with various junk and knick knacks. His name is Grindel. He will try to sell the PCs all sorts of strange items.
41	一只巨大的麋鹿在远处注视着队伍，它看起来仿佛戴着一顶由树枝和藤蔓编织成的王冠。 A great elk is seen watching the party from a distance. It almost looks as if the elk is wearing a crown made of twigs and vines.
42	队伍开始感到一种压倒性的恐惧，他们注意到经过时，当地的小型野生动物纷纷倒下死去。鸟儿和松鼠变得僵硬，然后从树枝上坠落，摔死在地面上。 The party begins to have an overwhelming sense of dread, they start to notice the smaller local wildlife dropping dead as they pass by. Birds and squirrles going stiff and then falling dead from branches and plumetting to the ground.
43	一只巨大的蜘蛛，体宽超过十英尺，在该地区被发现。它一直在将中小型牲畜拖回自己的网中。一支队伍正在集结以追捕它。 A massive spider, more than ten feet across has been spotted in the area. It has been dragging small and medium-sized livestock back to its web. A posse is being put together to hunt it down.
44	队伍注意到一尊巨大且略显荒芜的石像，它已被岁月和风雨侵蚀。雕像呈方形，风格简约，形似一个佩戴骷髅项链的人形，正用长矛刺穿一只鹿。 The party notices a big, somewhat overgrown, stone statue. It is worn down by time and weather. The statue is squarish and somewhat simplistic. It appears to be a man-shaped figure wearing a necklace of skulls who is impaling a deer with a spear.
45	一只巨大的獒犬飞奔而过，紧随其后的是一位筋疲力尽的战士，手中握着一条连着断掉项圈的皮带。 A massive mastiff comes bounding by, shortly followed by an exhausted warrior holding a leash attached to a broken collar.
46	一位年迈的骑士和他的年轻侍从正在森林中旅行。除了他们骑乘的马匹外，骑士还牵着一匹精良的战马。他们各自穿着黄红相间的战袍，上面绣有黑色狮子。他们只会说一点通用语，但显然正在执行某种任务。 An aged knight and his young squire are travelling the forest. In addition to the horses they ride, the knight also has a fine war horse in tow. They each wear a yellow and red tabard with a black lion on it. They each only speak a little common, but are apparently on some sort of quest.
47	队伍遇到一座由姜饼制成的中型小屋，通往小屋的小径上点缀着各种糖果。一位和蔼的老妇人邀请你们共进晚餐。 The party comes across a medium-sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy dotting the path to it. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.
48	在看似烧焦的圆木上休息后，你起身伸展，准备继续旅程。突然，你闻到一股非常甜美、近乎糖果般的香气。你循着气味，发现你休息的圆木下长出了一片紫色、白色、橙色和黄色的蘑菇。 After resting on what appears to be a burnt out log, you stand, stretching, ready to continue your journey. You suddenly pick up a whiff of a very sweet, almost candy like scent. You follow your nose and discover a patch of purple, white, orange and yellow mushrooms growning from underneath the log you were resting on.
49	一条小溪横穿小径。水不深，最多一英尺，过溪并无特别之处。但稍往上游可见一座简陋的桥梁，显然过去小径曾利用这处较干的过河点。桥不过是几块木板和两端的一堆石头，其中一端已大部分坍塌。通往桥的路杂草丛生，无人使用。是什么让当地人避而远之？ A small brook cuts across the path. The water is not deep, perhaps a foot at most, and the crossing is unremarkable. But upstream a slight way a rudimentary bridge can be seen, and it is obvious that at some time in the past the path took advantage of this drier crossing point. The bridge is little more than a few planks of wood and a pile of stone at either end, one of which has mostly collapsed. But the route to it is overgrown and unused. What could have caused the local folk to avoid it?
50	猫群似乎在树上注视着队伍，数量众多。每当队伍成员靠近时，它们便逃跑得无影无踪（可能为某种黑暗势力充当瞭望哨）。 Cats appear to be watching the party from the trees. Dozens upon dozens of them. Whenever a member of the party approaches them they run away and can’t be found (may serve as lookouts for a darker force).
51	你发现一具尸体，眼睛和嘴里都塞满了泥土，仍紧握着嵌入最近一棵树的斧头。 You find a corpse with it’s eyes and mouth filled with dirt, still grasping the axe that is embedded in the nearest tree.
52	队伍遇到了八名在路边露营的霍比特人，他们喝白兰地喝得醉醺醺的。他们很乐意分享白兰地以及正在吃的奶酪和香肠。他们坚持称呼队伍中的每个人为“拉尔斯”，并开始用“拉尔斯”加编号来称呼每个人。“再来点白兰地吗，二号拉尔斯？”每次这样称呼都会让霍比特人们陷入一阵醉醺醺的傻笑。其中一名霍比特人会不断试图讲一个他记不起来的笑话。 The party runs into eight halflings who are camping along the side of the road. They are drunk on brandy. They are happy to share their brandy and the cheese and sausage they are eating. They insist on referring to everyone in the party as Lars. They start to refer to each person by the name Lars with a number after it. “Some more brandy, Lars number two?”. Each time it sends the halflings into a fit of drunken giggling. One of the halflings will continuously try to tell a joke he can’t remember.
53	队伍来到一座横跨河流的小桥前，阻碍了他们的去路。一只巨魔从桥下蹒跚而出，向队伍发起挑战，但奇怪的是，只要他们不试图过桥，它就不会公开敌对。它愿意接受少量的钱币或食物作为过路费，并且似乎能听懂通用语。 The party reaches a small bridge that crosses a river impeding their path. A Troll lumbers up from under the bridge to challenge the party but in a peculiar turn of events, is not openly hostile if they do not attempt to cross the bridge. He will permit passage for a paltry offering of coin or food and appears capable of understanding common.
54	一头野猪从灌木丛中冲出，獠牙上沾满泡沫般的唾液。它双眼充血地冲过来，却毫无自卫之意，所有攻击都显得心不在焉。是什么驱使这野兽如此求死？ A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?
55	队伍遇到一个被愤怒树精抓住的矮人。他向队伍呼救，自称是贵族，并承诺如果救他，将给予超乎想象的奖励！至于他是否真的是贵族，由DM决定。 The party comes across a dwarf caught in the grip of an angry treant. He calls to the party for help, claiming that he is a noble, and he can reward the party beyond their dreams if they help him! Whether he is really nobility or not is up to the DM.
56	雷声预示着突如其来的倾盆大雨。虽然大雨可能给队伍带来不便，但更大的危险是迅速增长的溪流，它揭示了路径（或营地）实际上是一条短暂的水道。 Thunder heralds a sudden and torrential downpour. While the heavy rain may be inconvenient to the party, a greater danger is posed by the rapidly growing stream of water coursing through the area, revealing the path (or campsite) to be an ephemeral watercourse.
57	一棵巨大的橡树耸立在十字路口上方，树上挤满了乌鸦，七具兽人尸体悬挂在树枝间。 A tremendously large oak tree looms over a crossroads. The tree is crowded with crows and the corpses of seven orcs hang from its branches.
58	队伍在路边发现了一辆被掀翻并点燃的马车。拉车的马已被杀死，大部分肉被割走。马车夫的尸体可在附近的灌木丛中找到。如果队伍检查烧焦的马车内容物，会发现车上装载着许多幸运符包裹。大部分已被烧毁或熔在一起，但他们还是找到了1d10件在火灾中完好无损的小饰品。 The party finds a cart on the side of the road that has been overturned and lit ablaze. The horse that was pulling the cart has been killed and much of its meat removed. The corpse of the cart driver can be found in the bushes nearby. If the party examines the contents of the charred cart, they find it was carrying a number of bundles of lucky charms. Most of them have been burned or melted together, but they do manage to find 1d10 trinkets that survived the fire intact.
59	玩家们发现一座建在小溪旁的木屋。木屋属于一位邪恶的炼金术士，他正将失败的实验品倒入溪流，导致下游发生诡异事件。 The players find a wooden hut built next to a small stream. The hut belongs to an evil alchemist who is pouring their failed experiments into the stream, causing strange things to happen downstream.
60	一只乌鸦似乎在跟踪队伍中的某个成员。 A raven seems to be following one member of the party.
61	你在一条常有人经过的小路旁发现了一具极度干枯的骷髅尸体，其碎裂的肋骨间插着一把装饰华丽的匕首。一具尸体能保持如此之久未被触碰，甚至达到这种腐烂状态，实属罕见，然而它因年代久远而脆弱不堪，不太可能是被放置在那里的。 You find a positively desiccated skeletal corpse on the side of a well traveled path with an ornate looking dagger between its crumbling ribs. It is highly unusual that a corpse could remain untouched even near as long as it would take to induce this state of decay, yet is so fragile from age it is unlikely that it was placed there.
62	一名随机玩家的钱袋从背包中掉出。当他们弯腰捡拾硬币时，1d4只松鼠靠近并迅速抓起硬币，跑上树去。 A random player’s coinpurse has fallen out of their backpack. When they kneel down to pick the coins up, 1d4 squirrels approach and begin quickly grabing the coins and running up into the trees.
63	一对木精灵正在为偷猎者设置陷阱。如果队伍证明是森林的朋友，精灵们会试图招募他们加入追捕猎人的任务。 A pair of wood elves are seen setting traps for poachers. If the party proves to be friends of the forest, the elves will try to recruit them on their quest to hunt the hunters.
64	队伍经过一片苹果园。任何未能通过体质检定的人都会莫名被吸引向果园。果园中央有一棵比所有其他树都大的扭曲苹果树，其果实巨大且呈现出最美丽的红色。那些未能通过第二次体质检定的人将不惜一切代价，包括战斗，以获取其中一个苹果。果园的主人不安地在树下踱步，他的头发和胡子凌乱，看起来已经好几天没睡了。他手持一把伐木斧。树基周围躺着三具尸体。 The party passes an apple orchard. Anyone who fails a constitution check is inexplicably drawn toward the orchard. At the orchards center is a gnarled apple tree larger than all the rest. It’s fruit is oversized and the most beautiful red. Those that fail a second constitution check will do anything, including fighting, to get their hands on one of the apples. The owner of the orchard paces erratically under the tree. His hair and beard are wild, and he looks like he hasn’t slept in several days. He is carrying a woodsman’s axe. Three corpses lay around the base of the tree.
65	你走近一片空旷的林间空地，当你靠近时，一座宽大的石塔突然在眼前显现。塔门打开，一位男子站在门口（但未跨过门槛）。他环顾四周，自言自语道：“又是30年过去了！”然后他发现了队伍——“你们好，进来吧！” You approach an empty clearing , and as you near a wide stone tower suddenly coalesces into view in the clearing in front of you. The door opens to a man standing in the doorway (but not crossing the threshold). He looks around and says to himself “Another 30 years already!” Then he spots the party - “Hello there, come inside!”
66	队伍遇到一场当地半身人举办的萝卜节。一个巨大的锅中煮着萝卜炖菜，那是玩家们见过的最大的锅。现场还有赛跑、舞蹈、美食等活动。 The party comes across a small local halfling turnip festival. A giant pot of turnip stew is cooked in the largest cauldron the players have ever seen. There are foot races, dancing, eating, etc.
67	队伍发现他们正被一群披着狼皮的人跟踪。“狼群”是一伙崇拜黑暗扭曲神祇的强盗，痴迷于捕猎。甚至一些当地贵族也参与其中。 The party notices they are being stalked by men wearing wolf hides. ‘The Pack’ is a group of bandits who worship a dark and twisted god, obsessed with predation. Even some of the local nobility is involved.
68	两名骑马旅者：一位身材魁梧的男子，身着全副板甲但未戴头盔，留着浓密的黑胡子，鼻子尖削，眼神冷峻，牵着第二匹马的缰绳，马背上坐着一位长发乌黑的年轻女子。男子会无视玩家继续前行，若被搭话也不予回应。女子神情沮丧，经过时看向玩家，并无声地比划出“救命”一词。 Two travellers on horseback: a very large man in full plate minus the helm, with a massive black beard, sharp, thin nose and cold eyes, leading the second horse by the reins, upon which rides a young woman with long black hair. The man will ignore the players and ride on, and will not reply if spoken to. The woman has a dejected look, and as she passes she looks at the players and mimes the word ‘help.’
69	一名受伤的赏金猎人从灌木丛中踉跄走出。他的手臂中了一箭，现在无力地垂着。他告诉玩家角色，他和同伴追踪三名臭名昭著的强盗到附近的一座树林山丘，但遭到了伏击。他的同伴被杀。他需要从同伴那里取回一个吊坠，交给那人的遗孀。如果玩家角色帮助他抓捕强盗，他将分给他们一半的赏金。 A wounded bounty hunter stumbles out of the bushes. He has taken an arrow through the arm, which now hangs limp. He tells the PCs that he and his partner tracked three infamous bandits to a wooded hill nearby, but they were ambushed. His partner was killed. He needs to retrieve a locket from his partner for the man’s widow. He will give the PCs half of the bounty if they help him capture the bandits.
70	你发现一片被砍倒的树木围成的巨大圆圈，中心站着一个营养不良、眼神狂野的兽人，手持巨斧，大喊着要抵御无尽重生的敌人。 You find a massive circle of felled trees, in the center of which is a malnourished and wild-eyed greataxe wielding orc, yelling about fending off an endless hoard of regrowing enemies.
71	队伍前方行进者需进行感知检定。若掷骰结果超过DC13，他们将发现路径中央设有一处伪装巨大的活板门蜘蛛巢穴。若掷骰结果较低，他们将落入陷阱，蜘蛛发动攻击，将其拖入洞中。 Whoever is traveling in front of the party should make a Perception check. If they roll about a DC13, they spot a camouflaged giant trapdoor spider’s nest set up in the middle of the path. If they roll lower, they fall into the trap and the spider attacks, draging them into the hole.
72	队伍在森林中遇到一个躲在树后的迷路孩子。孩子极度迷失，声称“树木活了过来保护了我”。孩子请求队伍帮助。如果被送回家，玩家们将受到赞扬，并为他们举办盛大的宴会。 The party comes across a lost child hiding behind a tree in the forest. The child is desperately lost, claiming that ‘the trees came alive and protected me’. The child asks the party if they can help. If returned home, the players are greeted with praise and a massive banquet in their honor.
73	路卫正将一名偷猎者拖出森林。他被铐着手铐，哭泣着说他只是为了养家糊口。他恳求他们发发慈悲。其中一名路卫拿着他杀死的两只野鸡。 Road wardens are dragging a poacher out of the woods. He is manacled, and sobbing that he only did it to feed his family. He begs them to be merciful. One of the road warden carries the two pheasants that the man killed.
74	树木摇动，雷声轰鸣，一位古老的树人分开树丛踏上道路。他们缓慢而慎重地谈论着“黑铁之人的河流在行军”，“如此喧闹而匆忙”，对这些事物感到好奇却不敢亲自询问。最后一支军队经过已是百年或更久之前。 The trees shake and thunder, and part as an ancient ‘treeman’ steps forth onto the road. They talk slow and deliberately, speaking of ‘rivers of black metal men marching’, ‘so loud and so hasty’, curious about what they are but too afraid to ask themselves. The last army marched by a hundred years ago or more.
75	在前方的林间空地上，队伍看到一只独角兽正在池塘边饮水。但当他们靠近时，它害羞地躲开，逃进了树林。 In a glade ahead, the party sees a unicorn drinking from a pond. But as they approach, it shies away and flees into the trees.
76	你遇到一位正在搭建晚间营地的孤独法师。他恳求队伍加入他（理由是人多安全），并会提供美味的茶。若被问及为何在此，他说要去当地寺庙见儿子。实际上，这位法师是位死灵法师，茶中有毒。 You come across a lone wizard setting up camp for the evening. He begs the party to join him ( on the grounds that there is safety in numbers), and will offer them delicious tea. If asked about why he is out here, he says he’s going to see his son at a local temple. The wizard is actually a necromancer and the tea is poisoned.
77	三位人类围坐在一张精致的桌子旁，桌上摆放着精美的茶具。周围数百码的范围内，散落着木精灵战士的尸体。这些人类礼貌地向队伍打招呼并邀请他们享用茶点，尽管桌子不够大，无法容纳所有人。他们解释说正在等待一位朋友，对这片区域知之甚少。如果队伍提及周围的尸体，这些人类会显得尴尬并转移话题，仿佛队伍犯了社交礼仪上的错误。 Three humans sit around an intricate table, carefully set with an exquisite tea service. All around them for hundreds of yards in every direction, the area is strewn with the bodies of wood-elf warriors. The humans greet the party politely and offer refreshment, although the table is not large enough for all to sit. The humans explain they are waiting for a friend and know little about the area. If the party refers to the bodies around them, the humans seem embarrassed and change the subject, as though the party had engaged in a social faux pas.
78	一只小森林生物，如松鼠，出现并开始对队伍进行哑剧表演。原来这是一位森林德鲁伊，因野兽变形法术出错，现在需要队伍帮助恢复原形。 A small woodland creature, like a squirrel, appears and starts pantomiming at the party. It appears it is a forest Druid that has had a beast transformation spell gone wrong, and now requires the aid of the party to return to his original form.
79	你偶然发现了一系列由山岭巨人和其森林地精崇拜者统治的洞穴。击败他们并不困难，然而战斗后你发现了早已死去的矮人探矿者及其同伴的尸体。看来这些洞穴富含银矿，而矮人的袋子里装着矿权证明。 You stumble acrossed a series of caves ruled by a mountain troll and his forest goblin worshippers. Dispatching them is simple, however after the battle you discover the corpses of a long dead dwarven prospectors and companions. It seems these caves are full of silver, and the dwarves bags contained the claim.
80	一只母熊正在溪流中教她的幼崽捕鱼。除非被攻击（或有人介入母熊和幼崽之间），否则它们对队伍没有敌意。它们不会逃跑，但会保持距离。 A mother bear is teaching her baby how to fish in a stream. They are not hostile towards the party unless attacked (or someone gets between the baby and the momma). They don’t flee but keep their distance.
81	远处你看到一点光亮。走近后，发现一盏灯挂在树上随风摇摆。灯里装满了油，但没有任何迹象表明是谁把灯挂在那里的。 In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.
82	当你穿过森林时，脚下的泥土变得愈发松软。你的角色检查周围，发现一把铲子靠在树上。这里埋了东西。是宝藏还是犯罪现场？当你的角色俯身靠近脚下松软的土堆时，一只枯瘦的手突然从地里伸出。 As you walk through the Forest, the dirt under your feet becomes softer. As your character inspects the area, he finds a spade leaning agains a tree. Something was burried here. Is it a treasure or have you discovered a crime scene? As your character leans towards the soft mound under his feet, an emaciated hand shoots out of the ground.
83	一位头发灰白、略显驼背的老人带着五只训练有素的小狗在城镇间旅行。他带着各种道具，如铁环和斜坡，还有一张微型桌椅，小狗们像人一样坐在那里。他有一辆由一匹瘦弱的骡子拉着的小车。一个十一岁的女孩，可能是他的女儿或孙女，与他同行并承担大部分工作。老人四处游历，是个出了名的八卦者，因此可以成为很好的信息来源。 An old man with wild grey hair and a bit of a stoop is travelling from town to town with five trained small dogs. He has various props like hoops and ramps as well as a miniature table and chairs which the dogs sit at as if they were people. He has a small cart pulled by a nag of a mule. A girl of eleven, either his daughter or his granddaughter, travels with him and does much of the work. The man travels widely and is a notorious gossip, so can be a good source of information.
84	一名队员被隐藏的石头绊倒。在他们即将摔倒时，感觉仿佛被什么东西“接住”了。附近的树人用藤蔓接住了玩家，防止他们受伤。 A party member trips on a hidden rock. As they are falling, they feel as though they are being ‘caught’ before hitting the ground. A nearby ent uses it’s vines to catch the player before they hurt themselves.
85	灌木丛茂密，将你限制在一条狭窄的小径上。它急剧向左转，然后向右转……到了一个死胡同。回头一看，那边也是死路。唯一的前进方式是砍开低矮的树枝和灌木。 The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub.
86	队伍发现一伙偷猎者，从荒野中带着一只刚猎杀的鹿出现。如果他们承诺对偷猎行为保持沉默，偷猎者会向队伍提供一块鹿腿肉。 The party spots a band of poachers, emerging from the wild with a freshly killed deer. They will offer the party a haunch from the deer if they promise to keep quiet about their poaching.
87	一支迷路的木精灵战团提出用补给和口粮进行交易。 A lost warband of wood elves offers to trade for supplies and rations.
88	一棵古树在最近的暴风雨中被吹倒。一具骷髅纠缠在树根中，手中紧握着一个带有非常熟悉符号的箱子。 An ancient tree has been blown over in a recent storm. A skeleton tangled in its roots holds a chest with a very familiar symbol.
89	一场司法决斗正在一男一女之间展开。她指控他娶她只是为了卖掉她的牲畜并携款潜逃。他则指控她对他施了魔法。 A judicial duel is taking place between a man and a women. She has accused him of marrying her only so he could sell off her livestock and disappear with the money. He has accused her of casting a spell upon him.
90	一家银行通过运河转移资产时在河岸搁浅，大量（3d100）银币正倾泻入河中。几位渔夫在下游设网拦截，但远处已传来路警的马蹄声。 A bank shifting its assets via canal has run aground on one of the banks and is now spilling copious amounts (3d100) of silver pieces into the river. Several fisherman have set up nets further down the river, but in the distance the sound of Roadwarden’s horses can be heard.
91	队伍听到附近树林中传来微弱的排箫声。若他们前去探查，会看到一个萨提尔正与两位朋友围坐在篝火旁演奏。萨提尔欢迎队伍加入他们休息。若接受邀请，队伍将与这三位林地生物一起享用蜂蜜味的麦酒、烤鱼和水果，直至天明。当队伍醒来时，萨提尔和他的朋友们已消失无踪。 The party hears a faint panflute in the woods nearby. If they investigate, a satyr is seen playing around a campfire with his two friends. The saytr welcomes the group to sit with them and rest. If the invitation is accepted, the group gets to drink honey flavored ale and eat cooked fish and fruits with the three woodland beings until morning. When the party wakes up, the saytr and his friends are completely gone.
92	你听到可能是精灵语的低语，周围的树枝都在颤动。木精灵通常比这安静得多，除非他们有意让你听见。 You hear whispers in what could be elvish and see branches shivering all around you. Surely wood elves are more quiet than this, unless they want to be heard.
93	一辆有篷马车载着一大家子难民沿着小路行进。祖母是位技艺娴熟的占卜师，会用符文石为人占卜，每次收费六金币。她几乎不会通用语，但她的儿子可以翻译。 A big family of refugees in a covered wagon is traveling down the path. The grandmother is a skilled fortune teller and will tell fortunes with rune stones for six gold pieces. She speaks almost no common, but her son can translate.
94	你遇到一支奇怪地缺乏保护的商队，只有几名身穿全副板甲的骑士守卫着一辆满载的马车，由一位身着红黑贵族服饰的苍白男子带领。仔细查看后，发现车上装满了尸体，商队首领以此为掩护，运送尸车前往附近城镇掠夺财富，并招募更多仆从加入他的军队。 You come across a strangely unprotected caravan, with but a few knights in full plate defending a full cart, being led by a pale man in red and black noble’s attire. Upon closer inspection the cart is loaded entirely with cadavers, the caravan leader using it as a cover for the corpse cart he’s transporting to raid a nearby town for riches and more servants to add to his army.
95	队伍遇到一群傍晚归家的捕猎者组成的狩猎队。如果与他们交好，他们能提供关于附近森林的有用信息。 The party comes across a hunting party made up of trappers heading home for the evening. If befriended, they can provide useful information about the nearby forest.
96	队伍发现一只受伤的惊恐猫头鹰熊幼崽躲在一大丛灌木下。队伍可以选择离开它，或收养它并照料它恢复健康。 The party finds a scared injured owlbear cub hiding under a large bush. The party can choose to leave it, or keep it and nurse it back to health.
97	你遇到一根巨大的石柱，横截面大致呈矩形，根据底部周围的植被和土壤状况判断，它似乎是最近才从天而降，直插入地。这石柱显然太大，非人力所能移动。在石柱与地面的交界处，你发现了一只手臂，显然连接着一个被压在石柱底下的身体。即使死去，它仍紧握着一卷密封的卷轴…… You come across a huge pillar of rock, roughly rectangular in cross section, that has, judging by the state of the vegetation and earth around the base, very recently arrived here, apparently coming from above and piercing the ground. It appears far too large to be moved by man power alone. At one edge of the interface between earth and pillar you find an arm, apparently attached to a body that must be crushed beneath the bottom of the pillar. Even in death it still clutches a sealed scroll...
98	一只戴着华丽项圈的狗出现，带领队伍来到一处被翻动的土地并开始挖掘。仔细观察后，队伍发现一具小女孩的尸体，她手中握着的牵引绳与狗的项圈极为相似。当他们转身查看那只狗时，它已消失无踪。 A dog with a fancy collar appears to lead the party to an area of disturbed dirt and begins to dig it up. Upon closer inspection the party finds the body of a small girl holding a leash that looks quiet similar to the dogs collar. When they turn to examine the dog, he is nowhere to be found.
99	一名猎人疯狂地从玩家身边跑过，声称在前方的空地上发现了一只白化熊，其皮毛可能价值连城！这只白化熊实际上是一位试图逃离猎人的德鲁伊。 A hunter rushes past the players in a frenzy. They claim to have spotted an albino bear in the clearing ahead, and it’s pelt could be worth LOTS of gold! The albino bear is a druid who is trying to escape the hunter.
100	路上方悬挂着一条大鱼，用绳子绑在树枝上。这究竟意味着什么？ There is a large fish hanging above the road. It is tied to the branch of a tree by a rope. What could it mean?
