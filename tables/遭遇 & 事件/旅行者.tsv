"1d200"	"旅行遭遇"
1	"你遇到一位年长的绅士，他正沿着小路行走，身后跟着六只小狗。每只狗都系着一条小牵引绳，绳子连在他装满狗衣服和玩具的大背包上。过去几年里，这位男士训练这些狗表演各种把戏。他正从一个城镇游历到另一个城镇，试图成为一名著名的表演者。 You come across an older gentleman traveling down the path with a group of 6 small dogs walking behind him. He has them each on a small leash that is attached to his large backpack, filled with dog clothes and toys. Over the last few years, this man has trained these dogs to preform tricks. He is traveling from town to town to try and become a famous performer."
2	"你经过一个身披红金色流动布袍的人，闭着双眼，正在表演一种极其缓慢的舞蹈。周围躺着几名昏迷的强盗。 You pass a person draped in flowing red and gold cloth, eyes closed and performing what looks like an incredibly slow dance. Around them are several unconscious bandits."
3	"你看见一位老妇人和一个小女孩正缓缓向你的队伍走来。靠近后，你注意到老妇人其实是盲人，而女孩正在引导她。当你走近时，老妇人变得异常激动，并说出一连串话语，每一句都可视为预言。 You see an old woman with a young girl that is slowly moving towards your group. When you come closer you notice that the woman is actually blind, and the girl is guiding her. That woman gets intense when you come closer and gives away a series of phrases, each of those can be treated as a prophesy."
4	"一对新婚夫妇正在前往森林中一处僻静小屋度蜜月。他们俩都迷人友善，但交谈越久，越明显感觉有些不对劲。尤其是，新郎在新娘意外身亡的情况下将获得巨大利益。 A pair of newlyweds on their honeymoon headed to a secluded cabin in the woods. They’re both charming and friendly, but the longer you talk to them, the clearer it is that something’s amiss. Specifically, it’s very clear that the groom has quite a lot to gain in the event of the bride’s untimely demise."
5	"你踢到一块石头，它突然长出腿和爪子。仔细一看，原来是一只拳头大小的螃蟹伪装成石头。周围的所有石头也纷纷显露出螃蟹的真身，开始四散逃入草丛。如果抓住一只，它会在下次长休时消失。 You kick a rock, and it appears to grow legs and claws. On close inspection, it is a fist-sized crab disguised as a stone. All rocks in the immediate area reveal themselves to be crabs as well, which begin scattering into the grass. If one is captured, it disappears during the next long rest."
6	"一只被拴在树上的狗。周围似乎没有其他人，但如果队伍带走了小狗，它的主人会试图找到它。 A dog leashed to a tree. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around, but if the party takes the pup its owner will try to find it."
7	"一位矮小的女子推着车兜售用过的魔法护符。她的助手是个聋哑巨人，正拉着那辆车，每当有人靠近时就会咧嘴笑。她名叫塔比莎，说话轻声细语，颇为迷人。稍加打听便知，这对伙伴曾是共同冒险的朋友。 A short woman peddling used magical talismans out of a cart. Her assistant, a large deaf giant who is pulling said cart, grins whenever someone comes near. Her name is Tabitha and she’s rather charming in a soft-spoken way. A bit of prodding into the pair reveals they are both friends who once adventured together."
8	"一位身着破旧长袍的男子，自称贵族，被邪恶的兄弟逐出家门。更可能是因贪婪愚蠢被赶出，但队伍可以自行发现真相，因为他不断提出更多请求。 A man in tattered robes who claims to be nobility who was forced from his home by a wicked sibling. More likely he was kicked out for being a greedy twit, but the party can learn that on their own time as he makes more and more requests."
9	"两只狗头人叠在一起，披着旧斗篷。他们自称是著名的龙裔战士，似乎并不知道自己其实是两只狗头人。 Two kobolds standing on top of each other wearing an old cloak. They claim they are a famous dragonborn warrior, and they do not seem to know that they are actually two kobolds."
10	"一对看似被遗弃的马匹。进一步检查发现它们仍佩戴着马具，似乎是被匆忙遗弃的。 A pair of horses, seemingly abandoned. A further inspection reveals they are still wearing riding tack and seemed to be abandoned in a hurry."
11	"一个正在挖坟墓的人，旁边裹着某种尸体的裹尸布。 A person digging a grave, with a body of some sort in a shroud nearby."
12	"一位穿着圣骑士盔甲的蜥蜴人。他拙劣地模仿着盔甲原主人的行为，假装自己是守序善良。或者，他在得到装备后改变了心意。无论如何，他现在很饿。 A lizard folk wearing a paladin’s armor. He poorly impersonates the paladin whose armor he has and pretends to be lawful good. Or maybe he’s had a change of heart after getting the gear. Either way, he’s hungry."
13	"一位牧羊人带着十几只羊。他坚称所有的羊都是他的，并不时回头张望。 A shepherd with a dozen sheep. He keeps insisting that all the sheep are his and keeps looking over his shoulder."
14	"一支十人路工队正在路中央移除树桩。其中四人手持弓箭，抱怨一位树精干扰工作。两人实际负责移除树桩，其余人则在“监督”。 A 10-man road crew removing a stump from the middle of the road. Four of the crew are armed with bows and complain about a dryad interfering with their job. Two are doing the actual work of removing the stump. The rest are ‘supervising’."
15	"一场山洪阻断了部分道路。一位术士站在附近，提出以小额费用清理出一条干燥通道。术士言而有信，开辟了一条通往对岸的干燥水道。过河后，水道、山洪和术士都消失了。 A flash flood has blocked part of the road. A sorcerer is standing nearby offering to clear a dry path for a small fee. The sorcerer is true to their word and forms a dry channel to the other side. After crossing, the channel, the flood and the sorcerer disappear."
16	"一只纯黑、异常高大的塔巴克西。她以DM选择的魔法物品换取一个有趣的故事。玩家必须讲述一个揭示其部分背景的故事，并通过DC 14的说服检定才能获得物品。每个玩家只能尝试一次，但每次失败，塔巴克西的兴趣都会减弱，DC增加2。如果塔巴克西的DC达到20，她会失望地收回提议并离开。 A pure black, unnaturally tall Tabaxi. She offers a magical item of the DMs choice in exchange for an interesting story. A player must offer a story that reveals a portion of their backstory and beat a DC 14 persuasion check to receive the item. Each player may attempt this once, but each time it is failed the Tabaxi’s interest wanes, increasing the DC by 2. If the Tabaxi’s DC reaches 20, she retracts, unimpressed, and leaves."
17	"一个贫穷的小家庭，带着全部家当，正迁往新城镇。 A small and poor family, all their belongings in tow, moving to a new town."
18	"一位售卖魔法矿物、水晶和粉尘的火蜥蜴巫师。他住在一间中央有巨大火堆的小屋里，大部分时间都在家中制作粉末并在火边进行手工艺。尽管他并不算最友善，但他聪明、强壮且乐于助人。他出售魔法与非魔法珠宝、烟火、法术和配方所需的组件与材料。 A Firenewt wizard who sells magic minerals, crystals and dusts. He lives in a hut with a large fire in the middle. He spends most of his days at home making powders and crafting near the fire. Although he is not the kindest, he is smart strong and helpful. He sells magical and non-magical jewelry, fireworks, components and ingredients for spells and recipes."
19	"一只迷路后住在洞穴里的孤独沼泽蛙人。他自认为是洞穴的皇帝，手下有青蛙和蟾蜍作为仆从和守卫。 A lonely Bullywug who got lost and lives in a cave. He considers himself the emperor of the cave. He has other frogs and toads as minions and guards."
20	"你看到两个骑马的身影：一个半身人和一个绿龙裔。他们小跑了一英里，直到在路边遇到一支戒备森严的华丽商队。原来，龙裔是一位参议员，正从外村返回。他们停下来喂马饮水，龙裔不小心把钥匙掉在了商队里。半身人是来自下一个城镇的锁匠。 You see two figures riding on horseback: a halfling and a green dragonborn. They trot along for about a mile until they come across a heavily guarded ornate caravan on the side of the road. As it turns out, the dragonborn is a senator, on his way back from a trip to the outer villages. They stopped to feed and water the horses, and the dragonborn accidentally dropped his keys in the caravan. The halfling is the locksmith from the next town over."
21	"一只流浪狗，饥饿且肮脏，急需帮助。它戴着项圈，上面附着一张纸条，似乎是求救的信号！ A stray dog, hungry and dirty, desperately needing help. It has a collar with a note attached to it which seems to be a cry for help!"
22	"一支完全同职业但不同专长的敌对队伍。他们对同行有些令人厌烦，且正要去完成与队伍相同的任务/使命/目标。 A Rival party of the exact same class but different archetypes. They are a little obnoxious to their counterparts and are out to do the same quest/mission/thing the party is up to."
23	"一位骑马旅行的黑骑士。可能被揭露为某种幻象，或是游荡的Boss型怪物。 A black knight traveling on horseback. Could be revealed to be some sort of illusion, or a wandering boss-type monster."
24	"一个饥饿的乞丐，若得到帮助，日后会前来相助；若遭冷落，则会反其道而行之。 A hungry beggar, who if helped will come to their aid at a later date, if shunned will do the opposite."
25	"一个疯狂的老头，自称知道一片充满魔法的秘密森林所在。你跟随他，但实际上他只是想带你回他家，因为自从妻子去世后他一直很孤独。 A crazy old man who claims to know where a secret forest full of magic is located. You follow him but he is actually just trying to take you back to his home because he has lonely ever since his wife died."
26	"两位年长男性各自骑着一只巨型蜗牛。他们出售常见的魔法物品、附近洞穴系统的地图，并可能教导队伍如何增强药水效果。 Two older males each riding a giant snail. They sell common magic items, maps of nearby cave systems, and may teach the party how to enhance potions."
27	"一个拥有锐利蓝眼的男子，除双眼外所有可见的肌肤都裹着布条。他身披破旧肮脏的贵族服饰，手持宗教典籍。他礼貌而专注，显然虔诚，嗓音低沉丝滑。细看之下，他的肌肤似被灼伤。他所到之处，厄运与死亡的预兆如影随形。 A man with piercing blue eyes, all visible flesh but his eyes wrapped in cloth bandages. Adorned in worn and dirty cloths of a nobleman and carrying a religious text. He is polite and intense obviously religious and with a deep silky voice. Upon closer inspection, his flesh appears burned. Omens of doom and death follow in his wake."
28	"一队卫兵正将他们敬爱的伯爵夫人的遗体运回故乡。交谈中，卫兵们怀疑其中存在阴谋，请求冒险者们协助调查。 A group of guardsmen transporting the corpse of their beloved countess back to her homeland. Upon conversation, the guardsmen believe foul play was involved and ask the adventurers to investigate."
29	"哈林，半身人厨师和他的员工们，全是半身人。他们四处旅行，寻找据说最美味的忧郁蘑菇。一位高大温和的半兽人是他们的保镖，绰号“欢乐”。 Harrin, the halfling Chef and his employees, all halflings. They travel in search of the Gloomy Mushroom, said to be the most delicious thing there is. A big and gentle half-orc is their bodyguard. His nickname is Joy."
30	"一位盲人拄着棍子在路上蹒跚而行。如果队伍停下来与他交谈，他会谈起自己年轻时曾是这片地区最出色的强盗。问题在于，他失明后并未金盆洗手。他的同伙正藏匿在路旁的荒野中，用弹弓和短弓瞄准队伍准备射击。 A blind man stumbling along the road with a stick. If the party stop to talk to him, he will talk about how he was the best bandit in the area in his youth. Problem is he never quit when he lost his sight. His buddies are hiding in the wilderness on the side of the road and have been lining up shots on the party with their slingshots and short bows."
31	"一支名为“龙之心”的巡回吟游诗人乐队，正处于他们“史上最大巡演”的中途，在世界多个城市演出。他们可能在不同的道路上反复出现。 A band of travelling bards called Heart of a Dragon on a middle of their ‘biggest tour ever’ where they are playing in multiple cities of the world. They could be a recurring encounter on different roads."
32	"一群僧侣正前往他们教派的神殿朝圣，进行冥想和接受训练。 A group of monks on a pilgrimage to a shrine of their order to meditate and receive training."
33	"一支巡回马戏团，其中一位表演者正在路边提供表演（塔罗牌占卜或未来事件的隐晦揭示），收费几枚硬币。 A travelling circus with a bunch of performers, one of whom is offering to perform their tricks (tarot readings or a future event cryptic reveal) at the side of the road for a couple of coin."
34	"一位前往遥远圣地的宗教朝圣狂热者。这位朝圣者刚启程，充满干劲与愉快的传教热情。这是他首次朝圣，此前一直过着与世隔绝的生活。 A zealot on a religious pilgrimage to a far-off holy site. The pilgrim has only just started and is full of spunk and cheerful evangelism. This is the pilgrim’s first pilgrimage and up until now has led a very sheltered life."
35	"来自“利安德的光明洗衣店与薰衣草浴室”的巫师利安德。他们在旅途中遭遇袭击，巫师和学徒都受了伤（学徒的伤口中毒，几乎肯定感染、坏疽，若没有牧师的帮助，很可能致命），他们的马车和装备也被偷走了。 The wizard Leander from Leander’s Luminous Launderette and Lavender Lavatory. They have been assaulted on their travels, both the wizard and their apprentice were injured (the apprentices wounds poisoned and almost surely infected, gangrenous, and without the help of a cleric; probably fatal.) and their wagon and gear stolen."
36	"一伙伪装成朝圣苦行者的强盗，正前往附近寺庙。他们计划洗劫圣地并杀害庙内所有人。 A band of highwaymen posing as religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple. They plan to rob the holy site and kill everyone inside its walls."
37	"一位农夫带着家人，三头牛、两只羊、五头猪和七只鹅跟在满载的马车后。一把摇摇欲坠的摇椅顶上绑着一位祖母。 A farmer and family in tow, with three oxen, two sheep, five pigs, and seven geese following the heavily laden cart. A single rocking chair is perched precariously on top with a grandmother strapped into it."
38	"一队运气不佳的旅行艺人，他们有个小问题需要玩家解决。队伍中有一位初露头角的年轻故事大师，他必然会对玩家及其冒险故事深感兴趣。若能在此处施以援手或留下深刻印象，团队的事迹将在下一座大城市中传为佳话。 A travelling troupe of down on their luck performers with a small problem that the players can solve. In their troupe is a budding young master storyteller who is sure to be deeply interested in the players and their stories. Help or Impress them here, and tales of the team’s exploits precede them in the next big city."
39	"一个被愚弄的农夫，他买了一只装在袋子里的猫（被告知那是只小猪）。农夫沮丧不已，花光了所有积蓄，只希望能改变命运。 A dimwitted farmer who was sold a cat in a bag (and had been told it was a piglet). The farmer is despondent and has spent every penny they had in the hopes of changing their fortune."
40	"一位驾着老马和半坏马车的商贩，陷在了泥泞的车辙中。实际上，这位商贩是乔装旅行的间谍，马车故意陷入泥中是为了制造接触的借口。或者，商贩所载货物明显是从当地权贵或宗教团体处偷来的，玩家可能知情也可能不知情，而商贩愿意不惜一切代价避免被抓。 A peddler with an old horse and half broken cart who has gotten stuck in a muddy rut. The peddler is actually a spy travelling under cover and the wagon was deliberately stuck to provide an excuse to make contact. Alternatively, the goods the peddler is carrying are obviously stolen from a local power or religious group and the players may or may not know about it happening, and the peddler is willing to do a lot of things to not be caught."
41	"一位不称职的冒险者，不接受拒绝，计划前往玩家们要去的地方。这位冒险者很友好，但似乎过于努力了。 An incompetent adventurer that won’t take no for answer and plans to head wherever the players are going. The adventurer is friendly but seems to be trying too hard."
42	"一位骑士独自或带着极少的随从旅行。出于某种原因，他被迫卖掉了心爱的战马，或因其重伤而不得不放弃。又或者，这位骑士其实是位正在履行宗教苦行的圣武士，发誓在一个月零一天内不骑马或乘车。 A knight travelling with a very small, or nonexistent retinue. The knight has been forced to sell his prized warhorse for some reason, or have it knackered due to severe injury. Alternatively, the knight is actually a Paladin doing religious penance and has vowed not to ride a horse or cart for the entirety of one month and one day."
43	"一群满身泥土的矮人矿工从路边走来，提出用非常珍贵的宝石换取一些麦酒和食物（“不要干粮，要真正的食物！”）。他们刚发现了一处巨大的宝石矿藏，想要庆祝一下。希望你们随身带了些食物。 A pack of dirt-covered Dwarf miners’ approach from off the road, offering to trade very valuable gems for some ale and food (‘not trail rations, real food!’). They have just struck upon a massive gem deposit and wish to celebrate. Hope you have some with you."
44	"一位瘦削的猎人走近，请求你的帮助。他显然饥饿难耐，声称追踪一只枭熊到了附近洞穴，若你能协助击杀，将能养活他家人一个月。 A hunter approaches, asking for your aid. He is gaunt, obviously hungry. He says he has tracked an Owlbear to a nearby cave, and if you can help him kill it, it will feed his family for a month."
45	"你看见路中央躺着一具男尸，年纪不过十八九岁，喉咙被割开。若你停下查看，很快会看到一队搜索者从树林中朝你走来，他们正在寻找此人。你不该离他太近。 You see a man’s corpse in the middle of the road. A young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen. His throat has been cut. If you stop to examine the body, you quickly see a search party coming toward you from the wood. They are looking for the man. And you should not be so close to him."
46	"你注意到一个精灵瘫靠在树上，浑身是血，濒临死亡。他透露自己是信使，被强盗伏击。他告诉你他们没找到他携带的信件，信藏在他的靴子里。他请求你替他送信给几天路程外的Threader’s Hollow村的一位名叫Ella Corwyn的女士。若读信，内容是她儿子Dennis的简单消息，他正在精灵那里学习魔法。若送达，Ella会为你的队伍提供丰盛的羊肉炖汤和美味自制饼干，并让你们在她的谷仓过夜，与她的冠军猪Josephine为伴。 You notice an elf slumped against a tree, covered in blood and on the verge of death. He reveals that he is a courier and was ambushed by bandits. He tells you that they didn’t find the message he carries; it is hidden inside his boot. He asks you to deliver the message for him to a woman named Ella Corwyn in the village of Threader’s Hollow, a few days ride out of your way. If read, it is a simple message from her son, Dennis, who is training in wizardry with the elves. If delivered, Ella will feed your group (hearty lamb stew with delicious homemade biscuits) and offer shelter in her barn, alongside her prize pig Josephine."
47	"一只穿着背心、戴着圆顶礼帽的熊正从一辆停在路边的牛车上售卖精工制作的大师级乐器。他名叫威廉·贝尔顿三世爵士。他不会说话，但能理解并用粉笔在黑板上一笔一划地拼写出通用语的回复。若有人试图偷窃，他会毫不犹豫地以凶暴熊的姿态攻击。一群不同种族的吟游诗人在附近的空地上即兴演奏，听起来非常棒。若被问及，他们会将音质归功于乐器的品质。任何精通乐器且钱包鼓鼓的人必须通过DC 10的意志检定，否则会感到必须购买一件。价格高昂（2倍），但工艺似乎物有所值。车侧用华丽的花体字醒目地写着：“精工细作之顶级乐器，威廉·贝尔顿三世爵士，店主”。 A bear wearing a vest and derby hat is selling expertly crafted Masterwork musical instruments from an ox-drawn cart hitched to a tree by the side of the road. His name is Sir William Bearington III. He does not speak but can understand and scratch out misspelled replies on a chalkboard in Common. Should you attempt to steal from him, he will attack without hesitation, as a Dire Bear. A small collection of bards of various races have formed an impromptu jam session in a clearing nearby. They sound great, and if asked, they attribute the sound to the quality of the instruments. Anyone with a proficiency in a musical instrument and enough gold in their purse must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or feel compelled to buy one. Prices are high (2x), but the craftsmanship appears to be worth it. A flamboyantly painted sign on the side of the cart in bold calligraphy reads: “Musickyl Innstrumynts of Fynest Make, Experrtly Crafftyd by Sir Wm. Bearington III, Proprytor”"
48	"三个脏兮兮的农民正驾着一辆异常华丽的马车驶过。他们紧张地朝你们的队伍微笑挥手。通过DC 18的观察检定，可以发现马车侧面有一道血迹。 A trio of dirty peasants is riding past on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at your group. A DC 18 spot check will notice a smear of blood on the side of the carriage."
49	"你遇到了一群大约十几个年轻人类男子。他们手持长矛，身穿皮甲，似乎试图引起你的注意。如果遭到攻击，他们会立即逃跑。如果与之交谈，他们自称是士兵并要求征税。如果拒绝，他们会挥舞长矛，谈论国王的愤怒，但一有暴力迹象便会逃跑。实际上，他们是懦夫和逃兵，正试图南逃。 You come upon a group of a dozen or so young human men. They carry spears and wear leather armor. They appear to be trying to get your attention. If attacked, they immediately flee. If spoken with, they claim to be soldiers and demand a tax. If refused, they brandish their spears and talk about the wrath of the King but will flee at the first sign of violence. In reality, they are cowards and deserters, trying to make their way South."
50	"一名男子乞求帮助，声称“被强盗抢劫了。好心人，能载我一程去一天路程外的村子吗？”一旦有机会，他会试图偷走值钱的东西并骑上你的马逃跑。如果觉得合适，他会先捅你一刀。 A man begs for help. He has been “robbed by bandits. Please, kind strangers, a ride into the village that’s just a day’s travel away?” At the earliest opportunity, he will attempt to steal something of value and ride away on your horse. If it seems like a good idea, he will stab you first."
51	"一对年迈的夫妇拦下你，请求你留下一些银币作为对他们儿子的纪念，二十年前他就在此地遇害。 A very elderly couple flags you down. They ask you to leave some silver as a remembrance for their son, who was killed on this very spot twenty years ago."
52	"一个巨人坐在空地上哭泣，他的泪水声在空旷处回荡。他的妻子最近被冒险者杀害，看到你们的武器他会暴怒。如果你能安抚他，他会自称乌吉尔，并恳求你为他的妻子伸张正义，杀死兽人野蛮人“勇者卡纳克”、人类法师“黑手阿尔多”、矮人牧师“山中的托多克”和地精盗贼“斯温德洛·达芬顿·丁格尔”。 A Giant sits in the clearing, he is weeping. The sounds of his tears echo across the open space. His wife was recently killed by adventurers, and he will fly into a rage upon seeing your weapons. If you manage to calm him down, he introduces himself as Urgirr and will beg you to find justice for his wife by killing the Orc Barbarian “Karnak the Bold”, the Human Wizard “Aldo Blackhand”, the Dwarf Cleric “Tordok of the Mountain”, and the Gnome Rogue “Swindlow Duffington Dingle”."
53	"你遇到一个极其年老的矮人，赤身裸体如初生时一般，站在路中央要求支付10金币的过路费。他手持长棍，自称是道路之王。幸好，他长长的白胡子遮住了他皱巴巴的下体。 You come upon an impossibly elderly dwarf, naked as the day he was born, standing in the middle of the road demanding a 10 gp toll be paid. He wields a quarterstaff and proclaims himself to be the King of the Road. Thankfully, his long white beard shields his wrinkled nethers from your view."
54	"一名长弓手向所有挑战者发起狩猎比赛，赌注100金币。谁能在一小时内猎杀最多鸟类，谁就能赢得奖金。 A longbowman challenges all takers to a hunting contest. A 100 gold bet. Whosoever can kill the most birds in one hour wins the purse."
55	"莫蒂·梅内考姆，一位四处旅行的侏儒炼金术士，在这个意想不到的地方开设了店铺。他的价格略高于平均水平，但他喜欢笑话，如果有人能逗他笑，他会愿意讨价还价。他的儿子曼尼，一位手持长剑和钢盾的魁梧战士，正盯着你。 Morty Mennecaum, a traveling gnome alchemist has set up shop in this unlikely location. His prices are a bit above average, but he loves a joke and will negotiate if someone can make him laugh. His son, Manny, a burly fighter with a Longsword and steel shield, eyes you."
56	"一个幽灵在你路上徘徊，他是格雷戈尔·詹托斯。他请求你给附近镇上的妻子阿莉娅带个口信：“那不是意外。凯尔瓦尔剖开我是为了接近你。别相信他。”当你找到阿莉娅时，她已与凯尔瓦尔结婚九年，并育有一女。他们是个幸福的家庭。格雷戈尔十二年前去世，他在镇上并不受欢迎，因酗酒和殴打阿莉娅而声名狼藉。 A ghost hovers in your path. He is Gregor Jantos. He asks you to deliver a message to his wife Alya in a nearby town: “It was no accident. Kelvar cut me open to get to you. Don’t trust him.” When you find Alya, she has been married to Kelvar for nine years and they have a daughter together. They are quite the happy family. Gregor died twelve years ago, and he wasn’t well-liked in town. He had a reputation for getting drunk and beating on Alya."
57	"一个十二岁男孩盘腿坐在路边一块显得格格不入的巨石上，头戴一圈草绳。若有人搭话，他会睁开眼睛，点头示意并显得专注，但不会开口说话。他通过摇头来回答是非问题。他已立下沉默誓言，正前往成为僧侣的路上。若恳求帮助，他能带你前往他的寺院，在那里你可以住宿、用餐并修行长达一周。 A twelve-year-old boy sits cross-legged atop a boulder that seems out of place near this stretch of road. He wears a circlet of rope around his head. If spoken to, he will open his eyes and acknowledge you and appear to pay attention, but he will not speak. He will answer yes or no questions with shakes of his head. He has taken a vow of silence and is on his way to becoming a Monk. If begged for assistance, he can show you to his monastery where you may sleep, eat, and train for up to a week."
58	"一位镇民（加尔格）正与一位旅行商人（菲尼亚斯）争吵。他声称自己购买了50瓶神奇药水，但商人给他的箱子里只有46瓶。商人辩称顾客一定是喝掉了四瓶药水，因为他“有系统”。这场争执涉及8枚金币。 A townsman (Garg) is arguing with a traveling salesman (Phineas). He claims that he paid for 50 miracle cures, but the crate the salesman gave him only contained 46. The salesman claims that the customer must have drunk four of the doses of the cure because he “has a system”. The dispute is over 8 gold pieces."
59	"一名旅行商人驾着马车从你身边疾驰而过，半个村庄的人手持斧头和草叉在后面追赶。他们声称他利用他们，将装在瓶中的彩色威士忌卖给他们，并声称能治愈矿工热病。如果你抓住商人，他会辩称这是诚实的工作，为绝望的疾病贩卖希望。如果你成功威吓他（DC 15），他会归还镇上75%的钱。如果你在威吓检定中超过他的DC 10或更多，他会全部归还。 A traveling salesman blows past you on a cart. He is being chased by half a village who run after with axes and pitchforks. They claim he took advantage of them by selling them colored whiskey in a vial and saying it would cure Miner’s Fever. If you catch the salesman, he claims it’s honest work, selling people hope for an otherwise hopeless disease. He will give back 75% of the town’s money if you Intimidate him (DC 15). If you beat his Intimidate DC by 10 or more, he gives it all back."
60	"一队皇家卫兵正接近。六名壮汉，至少有些受伤，守护着一个看似铁制的坚固箱子。他们行进迅速。他们表示能立刻看出你们是值得信赖的人，并邀请你们加入他们，将极其贵重的货物运送给国王——这将使你们偏离原定路线数周——承诺为你们的努力提供微薄报酬。若你们拒绝，他们再次强调货物的无比珍贵，并解释说自己因旅途劳顿而疲惫虚弱，易受强盗袭击。若强行打开箱子（通过杀死守卫并撬开复杂的锁），里面是来自另一个王国的信件——一份和平条约。 A patrol of royal guards is approaching. Six stout men, at least somewhat injured, guarding what seems to be an iron strongbox. They are traveling quickly. They say that they can tell right away that you are trustworthy folk, and they ask you to join them in transporting their incredibly valuable cargo to the King–which is several weeks travel out of your way–promising a small reward for the effort. Should you refuse, they again stress how incredibly valuable their cargo is, and explain that they are tired and weak from their journey, and vulnerable to bandits. If the strongbox is opened (by killing the guards and picking a difficult lock), it contains a letter from another kingdom–a peace treaty."
61	"四个不超过八九岁的小孩自豪地拦住了你们的队伍。他们是冒险英雄，想加入你们的队伍，去消灭可恶的巨怪，斩杀可怕的巨龙，并且想熬夜到多晚都行。 A group of four small children, no more than eight or nine years old, proudly stops your group. They are adventuring heroes and want to join your party. To kill nasty trolls, and slay horrible dragons, and stay up as late as they want."
62	"一群手持临时武器和火把的镇民正朝附近城市进发，他们宣称要讨伐当地一位小领主，因其税收过高。若发生冲突，他们必遭屠杀。 A crowd of townsfolk equipped with makeshift weapons and torches is marching towards a nearby city. They proclaim that they are going to do battle with a minor local lord because his taxes are too high. If there is a fight, they will certainly be slaughtered."
63	"三位年长妇女组成的小团体，身着家纺衣物和脏污的披肩。其中一位脚部肿胀，走路一瘸一拐；另一位嘴唇肿胀感染，说话时流口水；第三位手指扭曲感染，无法抓握物品。她们分别手持剪刀、装有加工好的亚麻纤维的袋子以及纺锤和纺锤杆。她们实则是伪装成凡人的精灵，拥有奇异力量、预言洞察力及古怪的伦理观。或者，她们是动机可疑的女巫/巫婆，但遵循一条道德准则：对她们表示应有尊重的人将得到“奖赏”。 A small group of three older women, dressed in homespun and dirty shawls. One woman has a swollen foot and walks with a limp. One has a swollen and infected lip and drools when she speaks. A third has a twisted and infected finger, rendering her unable to grasp anything. One wields a set of shears, one a sack of prepared flax fiber, and a third a distaff and spindle. They are fey in disguise with strange power, prophetic foresight, and strange ethics. Alternatively, they are witches/hags with questionable motives, but a moral code of ‘rewarding’ those who show them respect they feel they deserve."
64	"一位穿着荒诞装束的词源学家，手持滑稽的大捕虫网，穿着短裤、遮阳帽、袜子和凉鞋。他们请求帮助捕捉只有他们才能看到的东西。 An etymologist in absurd getup with a comedically large bug net, short shorts, pith helmet, socks and sandals. They ask for assistance catching something only they can see."
65	"未闻其人，先闻其声。接近路弯时，两个声音大声互相抱怨：“你说你知道路怎么走！”“我说是往东，是你觉得买地图浪费钱！”路边倒下的树干上坐着一位女巨人，她肩上坐着一位女半身人，正递过酒囊给同伴。 You hear them before you see them. As you approach a bend in the road you hear two voices, each loudly complaining about the other. “You said you knew where we were going!” “I said that it was East, you’re the one who said a map was a waste of money!” A female Goliath sits on a fallen tree at the side of the road. A female Halfling is perched on her shoulders passing a wineskin to her companion."
66	"一个看似普通的男子在路边向队伍打招呼。他会主要与佩戴最多魔法珠宝的队员交谈。经过一番尴尬的对话后，他会迅速试图偷走珠宝并逃跑。当队伍追赶他时，他会变成一条古老的铜龙飞走，队伍将无法追踪他。之后，如果队伍在附近城市调查犯罪活动，他们可能会听说一个非法的魔法黑市。这条铜龙是黑市的主谋，在被对峙时会归还物品。 A seemingly normal looking man who greets the party on the road. He will mostly address the party member with the most magic jewelry. After some awkward conversation he will quickly make an attempt to steal the jewelry and run. When the party persuses him he turns into an ancient copper dragon and flies off. They won’t be able to track him. Later if the party is investigating crimes in a nearby city, they might catch word of an illegal magic black market. The copper dragon is the kingpin of the operation and will give the items back when confronted."
67	"天色渐暗，大雨倾盆。你看见对面走来一个男人，手持沉重的雨伞，身披厚重大衣。只要他还在视线之内，雨就一直下着，而他一旦消失，雨立刻停了。 The sky darkens and it begins to rain heavily. You see a man coming the other way, carrying a heavy umbrella and wearing a heavy coat. It rains for as long as the man is in sight, and then immediately clears."
68	"七名矮人矿工向你道早安，他们正前往矿井工作。 Seven dwarven miners bid you good day as they go to work in their mine."
69	"一位愿意以40金币出售其地区地图副本的制图师经过。拥有此地图的队伍在该地图区域内每日可额外行进1d4英里。 A cartographer passes who is willing to sell a copy of his map of the area for 40gp. With this map the party can travel at an additional 1d4 miles per day of travel within the area of the map."
70	"你遇到了一位漫游的贡德（或其他类似工艺之神）信徒，他愿意修复任何破损或损坏的装备。 You find a wandering disciple of Gond (or any other similar god of crafting) who offers to repair any broken or damaged equipment."
71	"一位受伤的年轻骑士躺在路边。他从恶龙手中拯救公主的使命再次失败。他曾与几位冒险者和雇佣兵同行，但如今他是唯一的幸存者。 A wounded young knight laying down on the side of the road. His quest to save the princess from the dragon had failed, again. He went with a few adventurers and mercenaries, but he was the only survivor left."
72	"一位占卜师坐在路边的马车上，似乎以马车为营生。车上挂着一块牌子，写着简单占卜收费1银币，复杂占卜则需1金币。（若被要求证明能力，她会施展一个简单的德鲁伊小法术，展示明天的天气，并让他们明天回来验证。此处可进行洞察检定。）若有队员求卜，DM可自行决定占卜内容，或预言他们即将遭遇死亡。 A fortune teller sits on the side of the road in a cart that she seems to operate her business out of. There’s a sign on it that explains that a simple fortune is 1 silver, but a more intricate fortune is 1 gold. (If asked to prove her talent, she performs a simple druidcraft cantrip showing tomorrow’s weather and tells them to come back tomorrow to see her if she’s correct. This may be a good place for an insight check). If any party member gets a fortune told, the DM can choose the fortune, or she can foretell imminent death in their path."
73	"一个地精正趴在一辆古怪的马车底下，摆弄着机械装置，嘴里咒骂个不停。他拒绝帮助，坚称你只会碍事。 A gnome is underneath a curious wagon, fiddling with a mechanical apparatus and swearing up a storm. He refuses help and insists you would just get in his way."
74	"三位高等精灵智者正在互相争执，争论一本关于奥术的书籍的解读。如果未被问候或打招呼，队伍对他们来说是完全不可见的。 Three high-elven sages can be seen bickering among themselves, arguing over the interpretations of a certain book on Arcana. The party is completely invisible to them if the sages are not addressed/greeted."
75	"一个双眼缠着绷带、一只靴子略大于另一只、手上装着某种机械义肢的男子，被一只似自然又非自然的猎犬牵引着。当被问及那只明显不自然的狗时，他只是说：“我相信他。是他带我离开那里的。” A man with bandages over his eyes, a boot slightly larger than its mate, and a sort of mechanical prosthetic hand being led a pseudo natural hound. When questioned about the clearly unnatural dog, he just says ‘I trust him. He led me back out of there’."
76	"一位拥有小餐馆/酒馆的厨师在一条人迹罕至的路边开店，纳闷为何从未有顾客光临。 A chef with a small restaurant/tavern sets up on a rarely traveled roadside wondering why he never gets any customers."

78	"一辆由两头牛拉着的车上坐着一位精灵和一位矮人。两人都穿着昂贵而花哨的衣服。矮人正抽着陶土烟斗，膝上放着一把装饰华丽的连弩。他们向队伍兜售商品，展示车上收集的武器和盔甲；都是二手货，有些明显使用过，盔甲凹陷，刀刃有缺口，还沾着血迹。其中不乏几件好货，价格也公道。若有魔法物品，商贩们并不知情，会当作普通物品出售。这些角色通过从战场上捡拾战利品赚了不少钱，大部分来自最近两位贵族军队的冲突。若你决定，精灵可能在袖子里藏着一两根魔杖以防不测。 An elf and a dwarf on a cart pulled by a couple of oxen. Both wear expensive, gaudy clothes. The dwarf is puffing on a clay pipe and has an ornate repeating crossbow on his lap. They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard. These characters make good money from looting battlefields, most of this haul from a recent clash between two nobles’ armies. At your discretion the elf may have a wand or two up his sleeve in event of trouble."
79	"一位妇女和六个小孩乘坐牛车接近。他们看起来脏兮兮、疲惫且忧虑，但如果队伍友好，母亲会分享她的故事：父亲抛弃了家庭，他们再也负担不起以前的家。母亲提出，如果队伍愿意护送他们到下一个村庄，她会给出一枚金币。传闻该地区有狼群，他们害怕在天黑前无法到达镇上。 A woman and six small children approach in an ox-drawn wagon. They appear dirty, tired and apprehensive, but if the party is friendly the mother will share her story: the father has run out on his family, and they could no longer afford to live in their previous home. The mother offers the party a single gold coin if they would accompany them to the next village. Rumor has it there are wolves in the area, and they are scared they won’t make it to town before nightfall."
80	"一位游吟诗人和他的爱人骑着驴子走来。他提出为你演奏一曲以换取一枚硬币。他是你听过的最糟糕的歌手。他收下你的硬币，继续沿着道路前行。 A traveling minstrel and his lover approach on a donkey. He offers to play you a tune for a coin. He is the worst singer you have ever heard. He takes your coin and carries on down the road."
81	"一座巨大的魔法石屋。石屋对所有魔法及锋刃武器免疫。屋内是一位强大而友善的巫师的家，他拥有众多魔法物品和药剂。他开设了一家商店，以略低于手册价格出售魔法物品。他以实际价值的110%收购稀有魔法物品，以90%的价格收购普通魔法物品。白天似乎有许多人前来，而夜晚则无人问津。这是因为他会在睡梦中说话。在任何一天，有1/3的几率他会在睡梦中施放d4个法术。 A large magic stone hut. The hut is immune to all magic as well as edged weapons. Inside is the home of a helpful powerful Wizard with many magic items and potions. He has made a shop which he sells him magic for slightly lower prices that the Handbook’s. He will buy any rare magic for 110% of its actual cost. He buys magic at 90% of its actual cost. Lots of people seem to come by in the day and no one seems to be there at night. This is because he talks in his sleep. On any given day, there is a 1/3 chance that he will use d4 spells in his sleep."
82	"两位著名剑客正在决斗。其中一人过去可能作弊，未来也可能计划作弊。他们的追随者要么试图阻止战斗并寻求帮助，要么在讨论条件并寻找中立仲裁者。 Two famous swordsmen, having a duel. One may or may not have cheated in the past and may or may not be planning to cheat in the future. Their followers are attempting to either stop the fight and seeking help or are discussing terms and seeking a neutral arbitrator."
83	"一只孤独的破跟鞋子，它被赋予了生命，性格鲜明，总在抱怨“我的脚都累坏了！”。这可能是某个巫师通过魔法在戏弄你。 A single, lonely shoe with a busted heel. The shoe is animated, and has a personality, always complaining that ‘My dogs are tired!’. It may or may not be a wizard pulling a trick on you via enchantment."
84	"一位旅行艺术家在附近的田野里支起画布，正在绘制野花。只需5铜币，他就能为你或你的任何队友在纸上创作一幅炭笔画。若支付5金币，他会停下手中的花卉画作，跟随队伍为其中一人绘制肖像，直至完成。若被问及作品，他会兴奋地展示自己的素描本，里面满是沿途遇到的各种人物肖像和素描。他自称从不忘记任何面孔，甚至可以根据你提供的细节，以10铜币的价格绘制某人画像。即使描述不够精准，他的作品也出奇地准确。 A traveling artist has set up a canvas in a nearby field and is painting some wildflowers. For 5 copper pieces, he will make a charcoal drawing on paper for you or any of your party members. For 5 gold pieces, he will stop his flower painting and spend time following the party painting a portrait of one of you until he is finished. If prompted about his work, he will get excited and show you his sketchbook. It’s full of various drawings and portraits of people he’s passed on the road. He says he never forgets a face and will even draw someone according to details given by you for 10 copper pieces. He’s surprisingly accurate even if you aren’t the best at describing things."
85	"一个醉醺醺的胖萨提尔，主要忙于打听下一场派对在哪里。 A portly drunken satyr mostly preoccupied with finding out where the next party is."
86	"一个自大的精灵蠢货，花了400多年时间掌握了一种已在当地灭绝的狼的嚎叫。几乎无需挑衅就会展示嚎叫，并期待你为之惊叹。 A pompous fool of an elf who has spent over 400 years mastering the call of a species of wolf which has since gone extinct in the area. Will demonstrate the howl with almost no provocation and expects you to be impressed."
87	"一位身穿红边白底大衣的胖硕老哥利亚，拖着一个装满礼物的大袋子 A portly old goliath in a red coat with white trim dragging a big bag full of presents"
88	"手持盒子的角魔，提议让你看一眼盒内之物，代价是你的灵魂。 Horned devil with a box in his hands. Offers to allow you to take a look inside in exchange for your soul."
89	"一位灰发斑驳的圣武士，手持巨剑，漂浮的盾牌正与两名隐形追猎者展开殊死搏斗。 A grizzled paladin with a great sword and a floating shield in a desperate fight with two invisible stalkers."
90	"一个沉睡的菲尔伯格，被他的宠物大象用象鼻卷着，大象尽职地沿着道路前行，礼貌地让路给其他行人。 Firbolg sleeping, held in the trunk of his pet elephant who dutifully trundles down the road, stepping politely aside to allow for traffic."
91	"三名被指派去洗劫附近文明的丘陵巨人。他们迷路了，想向队伍问路。 Three hill giants who have been assigned to sack a nearby civilization. They’re lost and want directions from the party."
92	"一位隐士，自豪地向路人伸出双臂，手中拿着一只脚跟有洞的旧袜子。他大声喊道：“看看我的袜子！它是不是很棒？！这袜子在我家传了好几代，从未湿过！它既不神奇也不特别，但简单来说，它就是有史以来最好的袜子！” A hermit, proudly extending his arms towards bypassers, holding a single old sock with a hole on the heel. Loudly exclaiming ‘Look at my sock! Isn’t it wonderful?! This sock has been in my family for generations and never once been wet! It’s not magical nor special, but it is, simply put, the best sock ever made!’"
93	"一位神情阴郁的恶魔领主推着手推车，车里躺着一位醉醺醺、兴高采烈的矮人，正大声唱着“墙上86瓶啤酒！”若被打断，矮人牧师会大声打嗝，皱眉耸肩，然后从“井里十亿只甲虫”重新开始唱，咯咯笑着入睡。见状，恶魔领主坐下开始哭泣。 A glum-looking demon lord pulling a wheelbarrow in which is lying a very drunk, very happy dwarf loudly singing ’86 bottles of beer on the wall!’ If interrupted, the cleric burps loudly, frowns and then shrugs, starting again at ‘1 billion beetles of butt in the well’ before giggling and falling asleep. At this the demon lord sits down and begins weeping."
94	"一位老人和他的四个哑巴儿子，全都衣衫褴褛，其中一个手持一根大拐杖。实际上，老人是一位巨魔法师的头颅，他的“儿子们”则是他的四肢，被变形为一群人类。老人会要求分享队伍的口粮，而他的儿子们会一直吃，直到食物被吃光。 An old man and his four mute sons, all dressed in rags, one carrying a large walking stick. In truth, the old man is the head of a giant mage, and his ‘sons’ are his limbs, polymorphed into a group of humans. The old man will ask for a share of the party’s rations, and his sons will eat and eat until no food is left."
95	"一个气味古怪的地精，斗篷下藏着各种魔法物品，包括一块能让你隐身六秒的小怀表、指尖点着蜡烛的手，点燃后能麻痹魅力值14或以上的100英尺内所有生物，以及一本空白小册子，看似对见到它的所有生物极为重要，实则毫无用处。 An oddly smelling gnome with various magic items hidden under his cloak such as a small pocket watch that turns you invisible for six seconds, a hand with candles on its fingertips that when lit paralyze every creature with 14 or more charisma in a 100ft radius, and a blank booklet that does nothing but looks extremely important to all creatures who see it."
96	"安格玛·剑行者——人类骑士——棕色头发与蓝眼睛，她自豪地带着一侧脸上的疤痕。她总是有点迟到，有点古怪，马厩里养着一只奥特雅格作为宠物。尽管剑术娴熟，她因房子闹鬼而搬离了家。 Angmar Bladewalker – human knight – Brown hair and blue eyes, she proudly wears a scar across one side of her face. She is always a bit late, a bit eccentric, and has an otuyagh in the stables that she raises as a pet. Deft with a blade though. She moved out of her house because it was haunted."
97	"赞恩·德雷克——高等精灵诗人——他有着非常长且卷曲的棕色头发，左侧剃光，棕色眼睛，粗糙的金色皮肤。他面容柔和，留着短须。他总是大声而戏剧性地说话。此外，他知道一位天使的真名。 Zane Drake – High Elf poet – He has very long, curled, brown hair shaved on the left side and brown eyes, with rough golden skin. He has a soft, typical face with a short moustache. He speaks loudly and dramatically at all times. In addition, he knows the true name of an angel."
98	"艾莱斯·法拉瓦尔——半精灵商人——她有着长长的卷曲黑发和绿色眼睛。她总是轻声细语，且非常虔诚。她的故乡被一场风暴摧毁。 Ayleth Falavaul – Half-Elf merchant – She has long, curled, dyed black hair and green eyes. She speaks quietly at all times and is deeply religious. Her homeland was destroyed by a storm."
99	"多兰·雷霆掘者——矮人贵族——永远不耐烦的多兰总是在大喊大叫。他有一头短短的金发和长长的胡须，每天早上都由妻子编成辫子。一位老朋友想要向他复仇。 Doran Thunderdelver – Dwarf noble – Endlessly impatient, Doran is always shouting about something or other. He has short blond hair and a long beard, which his wife braids every morning. An old friend wants revenge on him."
100	"波拉斯——龙裔法师——多疑且易怒，他非常关心当地镇民。一个名叫卡瓦尔的男子偷走了他的一本法术书。 Porath – Dragonborn wizard – Suspicious and prone to growling, he cares deeply about the local townsfolk. A man named Kavarr stole one of his spell books."
101	"一只（巨型）鹰俯冲而下，从队伍中偷走了某样东西。 A (giant) eagle swoops in and steals something from the party."
102	"空气中弥漫着沉重的嗡嗡声，路旁某处传来难闻的气味。调查发现一具驮兽的尸体，上面覆盖着正在进食的吸血蝙蝠。驮兽似乎携带着某种鞍袋。 A heavy buzzing is in the air and something smells badly somewhere off the road. Investigation leads to a carcass of a pack animal covered in stirges who are feeding off of it. The pack animal seems to be carrying a saddlebag of some sort."
103	"三位农夫赶着一小群山羊和一头牛经过。几分钟后，一个男人跑来，眼睛青肿，衣服凌乱，手持耙子，恳求队伍告诉他强盗带着他所有的牲畜往哪个方向去了。 Three farmers pass by with a small herd of goats and a cow. Several minutes later a man comes running along with a black eye, roughed up clothes, and holding a rake pleading with the party to tell him where the bandits went with all his livestock."
104	"你遇到一些看似在迁徙的人。他们因火灾失去了一切，正迁往最近的城市。他们会试图向你兜售物品，其中一人甚至想用女儿的手换一把金币。他们如此绝望，只为避免沦为乞丐。 You encounter some people seemingly migrating. They're migrating to the nearest city because they lost everything in a fire. They'll try to sell you things, one of them even tries to sell their daughter's hand in marriage for a handful of gold. They're that desperate to not end up as beggars."
105	"蹄声疾驰，在蜿蜒的道路上朝你逼近。需明智决策，因有十余匹骏马为争夺丰厚奖金正沿路狂奔。它们卷起漫天尘土，又有更多马匹呼啸而过。一名落后者从马背跌落，却被马镫牢牢绊住。 The sound of hooves traveling at great speed comes towards you on the twisting roads. Make some wise decisions because there are over a dozen horses galloping at high speeds along the road in a drag race for some serious prize money. They leave you in a huge dust cloud as even more pass. A straggler has fallen off his horse but he is stuck in the stirrups."
106	"一队15名面相粗犷的士兵用两辆重型马车堵住了道路。他们愿意为“公爵的援助”收取每人7金币的费用，将马车移开。（可谈判至4金币，但若更低，他们便会翻脸，宁可夺人性命。遭遇敌意时，他们会掀翻马车，利用底部预先切割的缝隙，在近乎全掩蔽的状态下发射弩箭，同时步兵则使用临时制作的塔盾向队伍推进。若阵亡5人且战局不利，他们将放弃抵抗，选择投降。） A group of 15 rough looking soldiers have barred the road with two heavy carts. They will roll them aside for a ‘’Duke’s aid’’ fee of 7 gold pieces per person. (They can be negotiated with up to 4 gold pieces but any lower and they turn sour and rather take some lives. Upon being met with hostilities they will overturn their carts and use the slits they cut in the bottom to shoot crossbows from almost total cover while their foot soldiers use a make-shift tower shield to advance on the party. If 5 of them die and they are not clearly winning they will give up and surrender.)"
107	"清晨，你发现几只巨型青蛙正在翻找你的物品，寻找食物。它们目前并无敌意。你打算如何应对？ In the morning, you find giant frogs rummaging through your stuff, searching for food. They're not hostile, for now. How do you deal with them?"
108	"傍晚时分，一位粗犷狂野的女子将靠近营地，询问是否可以共享篝火。她会提出与队伍分享三只猎获的兔子，以换取一夜的留宿。（她是一只狼人，但无意伤害队伍，只是渴望与人接触。她确实携带武器，但兔子并非用这些武器捕获。） Near nightfall a rough and wild looking woman will approach the campsite and ask if she can share the fire. She will offer to share three hunted rabbits with the party in order to secure a place for the night. (She is a Werewolf, but does not want to harm the party. She simply wants some human contact. She does have some weapons, but the rabbits have not been caught with those.)"
109	"荒野某处升起一缕烟雾。（当你靠近时，烟雾停止，但通过成功的生存检定，你可以找到一根仍在微微冒烟的树干。然而，成功的感知检定可能会揭示它其实是一个隐藏的烟囱。附近有一块可以侧向转动的大石头，下面藏着一个非法酿酒者的地下巢穴的隐秘入口。这些私酿者用某种奇异草药酿制出一种近乎有毒的烈酒，名为“多瓦”，其烈度足以灼穿普通人的胃壁（如同饮下酸液），专为矮人打造。据说，一杯下肚，足以让一个矮人醉得比一桶酒灌醉的霍比特人还要厉害。三位炼金术士兄弟将不惜一切代价保护他们的领地。） There is smoke coming from somewhere out in the wilderness. (When you go near, the smoke stops but with a successful survival check you can locate a still slightly smoking tree trunk. A successful wisdom check however might reveal it to be a hidden chimney. A secret entrance to an underground lair of illegal brewers is hidden nearby under a large rock that can be pivoted sideways. The moonshiners produce something that is nearly toxic called Dova made with some weird herb. It is strong enough to burn a hole in a normal human’s stomach (as if drinking acid) and is specifically made for dwarves. They say one cup can get a dwarf drunker than a halfling in a keg. The three alchemist brothers will protect their turf at all costs.)"
110	"泥石流摧毁了前方大部分道路，使其变成了一片湿滑的泥潭。 A mudslide destroyed most of the road ahead and turned it into a slippery mess."
111	"你遇到两位年轻人，一位身着贵族服饰，另一位笨拙地握着一把过于昂贵的细剑。这位贵族（决斗者）正在行使他发起决斗的权利，只因这位农民走路不看路，惊了他的马。（农民显然负债累累，但出于对女儿生命的恐惧（她正在路边哭泣，恳求他们停止），他只能听从命令。若决斗发生，他必死无疑。若队伍介入，贵族会打量他们，并提出每人一枚金币的贿赂，让他们让路，并保证在他父亲得知他们的干预后保住他们的脑袋。从各方面看，这家伙是个混蛋，但出身贵族。若遭遇敌意，年轻贵族会勇敢应战，但一旦战败（或死亡），他或他的父亲将亲自致力于毁掉这支队伍。） You come across two young men, one of which is in noble attire and the other is rather clumsily holding a rapier that is too expensive. The noble (duelist) is exercising his right to call a duel, this peasant didn’t look where he walked and spooked his horse. (The peasant is clearly out of his debt but does what he is told as he fears for his daughter’s life (who is crying at the side of the road begging them to stop), he will most definitely be killed if this duel takes place. If the party interferes the noble will size them up and offer them a gold piece each to get out of his way and keep their heads when his father hears of their interference, in all senses this guy is a prick, but one of nobility. If met with hostility the young noble will bravely fight but upon losing (or dying) he or his father himself will make it a personal mission to ruin this party.)"
112	"路旁传来咆哮与挣扎声，一只受伤的狮鹫（或双足飞龙）被困在偷猎者的装置中，她的左翼被某种连接着锁链的熊爪装置所伤。锁链被牢牢钉入树桩，旁边躺着一只山羊的尸体，可能是用来引诱她到此的。（这生物极度警觉，若非被40英尺的锁链限制，会立即攻击任何看到的人形生物。解救她并不容易，因为她现在对周围的一切都充满不信任。一旦有人试图解开锁链，灌木丛中便会射出箭矢，偷猎者会回来夺取他们的战利品，这再次激怒了这只野兽。） There is roaring and thrashing from somewhere off-road. A wounded griffon (or wyvern) is trapped in some poachers’ device and her left wing is damaged by some sort of bear claw device connected to a chain. The chain is locked and hammered into a tree stump, next to it lays the carcass of a goat that was probably used to lure her here. (The creature is very wary and will attack any humanoid on sight if it weren’t for her chain radius of 40 ft. Freeing her is not easy as she distrusts everything around her now. This is reinforced the moment someone tries to remove the chain as arrows fly from the shrubbery and the poachers return for their trophy, this turns the beast hostile again.)"
113	"队伍被一个从树中跳出的巨人分隔，同时强盗抓住一名角色并索要赎金。 The party is split by a Goliath jumping from a tree in the middle, while bandits grab one character and hold them ransom."
114	"一匹高贵的骏马疾驰过道路，骑手却不见踪影。（需进行技能挑战以阻止这匹野兽继续奔跑并安抚它（3次成功前允许2次失败）。马鞍包上嵌有徽章，内装纸质文件、一大袋银币（425银币）及一些旅行干粮。马鞍同样刻有纹饰，可能价值不菲。此马是从一处庄园盗出，骑手被马甩下致死。该地区所有人都认得这徽章。） A noble steed comes galloping over the road, the rider is nowhere to be seen. (A skill challenge is needed to stop this beast from running on and calming it down (3 successes before 2 fails). Saddlebags with a crest embedded on them are filled with paper documents, a huge pouch of silver (425 sp), and some traveling rations. The saddle is also engraved and probably worth a pretty penny. The horse was stolen from an estate and the rider was thrown off and killed by the horse. Everyone in the region would recognize the crest.)"
115	"一群孩子从你刚经过的村庄尾随而来。他们用自制的吹管向队伍射击浆果（+7命中，1点钝击伤害）并投掷石头（+4命中，1d4-1伤害）。他们在周围森林里布置了一些奇怪的陷阱以便在被追赶时逃脱（横扫树枝敏捷豁免，成功则本轮移动受限，失败则造成1d4点挥砍伤害）。 A group of kids follows you from the hamlet you just passed by. They are shooting berries at the party using improvised blowpipes. ((+7 to hit, 1 bludgeoning damage) and throwing stones (+4 to hit, 1d4 -1 damage). They have set some weird traps in the surrounding forest to get away when followed (sweeping branch dexterity save, which cuts movement for that round on a success and deals 1d4 slashing damage on a fail)."
116	"当你踏入一家路边客栈，正巧撞见两名赏金猎人与他们的猎物对峙。整个客栈被翻得一片狼藉，桌子东倒西歪，靠近门口处，一名腿部受伤的赏金猎人正躲在掩体后，紧张地为十字弩上弦，试图协助他那正被四面围困的同伴。三名半兽人掠夺者正缓缓包抄向躲在破桌后的赏金猎人，而第四名半兽人已倒在房间中央，眼中插着一支弩箭。尽管如此，赏金猎人们显然正逐渐败给他们的猎物。 When you visit a roadside inn you walk into a showdown between 2 bounty hunters and their quarry. The whole inn is tossed and tables lay on their sides, close to the door a wounded (leg) bounty hunter winds his crossbow to shoot from cover assisting his companion that is now being boxed in from all sides. The three remaining half-orc marauders are slowly flanking the bounty hunter that has sought cover behind a broken table, a fourth half-orc lays dead in the center of the room with a crossbow bolt in an eye socket. Regardless, the bounty hunters are clearly losing against their prey."
117	"在一个小村庄附近，你看到几个孩子在玩耍。其中一个孩子爬上了树，似乎想要够到一个鸟巢。这看起来很危险，地上的孩子们显得不安。 Near a small hamlet you spot a few children playing. One of them climbs in a tree, seemingly to reach a nest. It seems dangerous, and the children on the ground look uneasy."
118	"一只戴着菲斯帽的猴子从灌木丛中跳到队伍面前，看着你。它微微歪头，做了个下流手势，然后跑开了。 A monkey wearing a Fez jumps out of a bush in front of the party, looking at you. It tilts its head slightly, makes an obscene gesture and runs off."
119	"你在旅途中迷了路，现在所有人都站在一条尽头被杂草丛生覆盖的小径上。 You got lost during your travels, and now you are all at a path ending in an overgrown mess."
120	"一名渔夫奋力拉起渔网。（若有人协助，会发现渔网被一个异常沉重的小箱子卡住了。） A fisherman struggles to pull his net up. (If assisted, it turns out to have been stuck on a small, impossibly heavy box.)"
121	"一位衣着考洁、自称发明家的人走向你，声称他有一枚指向最近恶魔的罗盘。而罗盘径直指向了你的队友。 A well dressed person claiming to be an inventor comes up to you, saying he has a compass that he claims points to the nearest demon. It points straight to a party member."
122	"你发现了一张当晚贵族聚会的邀请函。 You find an invite to a noble gathering that evening."
123	"你们全都掉进了一株大型食肉植物的天然陷阱中。 You all fall into the natural trap of a large carnivorous plant."
124	"一位旅人竭力向你推销一只普通但还算不错的山羊，要价50金币。（他拒绝讨价还价，看上去骨瘦如柴。他因欺骗女巫而被秘密诅咒，只能尝试卖掉这只山羊。如果有人支付了金币，山羊和金币都会消失，而他会倒下。） A traveler tries desperately to sell you a decent but mundane goat for 50gp. (He refuses to haggle. He looks emaciated. He was secretly cursed for ripping off a witch and can only try to sell this goat. If someone pays for the goat, it and the gold disappear and the man collapses.)"
125	"一只小而凶猛的狗在路中间徘徊。 A small but vicious dog wanders across the path."
126	"远处可以看到几只灰熊，正在嗅探寻找食物。 A few grizzly bears can be seen in the distance, sniffing for food."
127	"一个披着斗篷的身影站在道路的拐弯处。（它依次用深沉、正常、极高音三种声音说道：止步，缴纳十五枚金币。实际上，这是三个披着斗篷的狗头人。如果队伍拒绝支付15金币的过路费，它们将拔出六把匕首。） A hooded figure stands in a bend on the road. (It speaks with three voices in order: Deep, Normal, Very High Pitch: GO NO FURTHER PAY FIFTEEN GOLD. The figure is in reality three kobolds in a cloak. They will draw six daggers if the party refuses to pay a 15g tithe)."
128	"你在岩壁上发现了一片发光的石头露头。附近隐藏着一个中等大小的洞穴，里面布满了原始的赭石壁画，并留有长期废弃的火堆痕迹。 You spot an outcropping of glowing stone on a rockface. A medium sized cave filled with primitive ochre paintings is hidden nearby and evidence of long abandoned fires inside."
129	"此处地面焦黑，树木和灌木的残骸焦枯静立，死寂无声。 The ground through here is scorched and blackened, and charred remains of trees and bushes are standing dead and still."
130	"你听到树林中传来美妙而几乎无法抗拒的歌声。（调查后，他们发现一个在吸引力方面完全符合他们所有标准的人。这是一个将考验他们道德的妖精生物。如果他们失败，该生物将发起攻击。） You hear beautiful, almost irresistible singing coming from the woods. (Upon investigation, they find a person that ticks all the right boxes in terms of attractiveness for them. It is a fey creature that will test their morality. If they fail, the creature will attack."
131	"你看到树林中闪烁着奇异的光芒，不由自主地想要前去探查。（鬼火。） You see curious lights in the woods, and feel compelled to investigate. (Will-o-wisps.)"
132	"你听到美妙的歌声，循声望去，发现一位美丽的裸体女子正在河中沐浴。（可能是仙女、树精或其他精灵。这将考验角色的道德。若通过考验，他们将获得礼物，如魔法浆果。若失败，精灵会试图将其溺死。） You hear beautiful singing, and upon inspection see a beautiful nude woman bathing in a river. (nymph, dryad, or other fey. Will test the character's morality. If they pass, they are given a gift, such as goodberries. If they fail, the fae will attempt to drown them.)"
133	"你在十字路口遇见一个神秘身影。他赐予你一份恩惠。低等级时，这可能是一件既有利又受诅咒的物品。高等级时，这可能是一个终将变质的愿望。 You meet a shadowy figure at a crossroads. He offers a boon. At low levels this could be an item which is both beneficial and cursed. At high levels, it could be a wish that will turn sour."
134	"你遇到一个步履蹒跚、看似贫困的男子，正艰难地推着一辆小车。令人惊讶的是，车里装满了金币，大约有1000枚！如果玩家帮助他推车，他会变得焦躁不安，并让这些好心人离开。如果玩家偷走这些钱，他们会发现这些金币被诅咒了。金币的重量会增加到他们所能携带的极限。如果他们丢弃这些硬币，一旦他们移开视线，金币就会重新出现在他们的包里。角色无法花费这些金币，当他们试图赠送时，金币会变热并灼伤他们。摆脱这些金币的唯一方法是被抢劫或使用解除诅咒的法术。诅咒会影响到第一个偷取任何金币的人。剩余的金币无论最终落在何处，都会消失并重新出现在第一个偷取者手中。 You meet a hobbled, impoverished looking man struggling to push a small cart. To your astonishment, the cart is full of gold, probably 1000 pieces! If the PC's help the man push his cart, he grows agitated and tells the do-gooders to leave. If the PC's steal the money, they find it is cursed. The money increases in weight to the very limit of what they can carry. If they discard the coins, they reappear in their bags the moment they turn their gaze away. The character cannot spend them, and when they attempt to give them away, the coins turn hot and burn them. The only way to get rid of the coins is to be robbed or to use a remove curse spell. The curse affects the first person to steal any coins. The remaining coins will disappear from wherever they end up and reappear in the first person."
135	"一群德鲁伊从远处观察着队伍。若被接近，他们会询问队伍的身份，但对自己则守口如瓶。若被跟踪，他们表现出极大的耐心；只需等待尾随的队伍在荒野追踪中感到厌倦或迷路即可。 A group of druids watch the party from a good distance away. If approached, they will ask about who the party is, but reveal nothing about themselves. If followed, they prove very patient; they will simply wait until the following party gets bored (or lost) trekking through the wilderness after them."
136	"一大群动物（数量在20到200之间，视体型而定）轰然穿过道路，可能出现在队伍前方、后方或周围。它们可能正在迁徙，或是逃离某个事件。 A large number of animals(somewhere between 20 and 200 depending on size) thunder across the path, either in front of, behind, or around the party. They may be migrating, or fleeing from some event."
137	"一颗流星坠落在远处的地面上。 A falling star plummets to earth a good distance away."
138	"某种构装体（可能是魔像或更低级的存在）正沿路反向而行。由于其有限的感知力，它无法传达其目的，但并无敌意。 A construct of some kind (possibly a golem, or something lesser) is traveling the other way on the road. Due to its limited sentience, it cannot communicate its goals, but it is not hostile."
139	"队伍在路中央发现了一只看似死去的狼。实际上它是在装死，协助其他狼设下埋伏。 The party comes across a wolf, seemingly dead in the middle of the path. It is actually playing dead and helping other wolves with an ambush."
140	"路边矗立着一座石质石碑，上面刻有德鲁伊文字，内容大致关于净化周围土地。当队伍离开其20英尺远时，石碑可能会消失（由DM决定）。 A stone monolith sits at the side of the road. It has writing in druidic, something about purifying the earth around it. It may disappear after the party goes more than 20 feet away from it (DM's discretion)."
141	"你们是著名的冒险者，每经过一个城镇，人们都会抛洒鲜花，簇拥而来。各种礼物和食物纷至沓来。 You are famous adventurers and every town you pass flowers are thrown, and people flock to you. All manner of gifts and food are given."
142	"当队伍扎营时，一位骑着幽灵马、手持鞭子的幽灵显现并接近营地。幽灵说道：“走！我们不能停！这里不安全。”如果队伍见多识广，他们会认出这幽灵是一位军官。只要队伍继续沿路前行，即使速度缓慢，幽灵也会满意地跟在后面；但若有人停下，幽灵便会鞭打他们以催促前进。幽灵会整夜驱赶队伍直至清晨，然后说：“我们到了，安全了。他们被远远甩在后面了。”随即消失。这幽灵原是一支军队的成员，他们在夜间被尾随的兽人伏击而亡，因此幽灵才会驱赶旅人夜行，即便已无危险，也不让他们休息。 As the party sets up camp, a phantom riding a phantom horse and armed with a whip manifests and approaches the camp. The ghost says ""GO! We can not stop! It is not safe."" If the party is knowledgeable enough, they will recognize that the ghost is a military officer. As long as the party continues on the road, even if they are going slow, the ghost will follow behind appeased, but if someone stops, it will whip them to get them moving. The ghost will march them all night till morning, where it will say ""We made it. We are safe. They are far enough behind."" and vanish. The ghost was part of a military troop that was ambushed and killed in the night by orcs following them, which is why the ghost drives travelers through the night instead of letting them rest, even if there is no danger anymore."
143	"队伍在路上一闪而过地瞥见了一只幼兽（大象、熊、河马，视环境而定）。不久后，一只愤怒的母亲从侧翼猛冲向他们。 The party spots a baby animal (elephant, bear, hippo, whatever suits the environment) on the road only for a split second. Soon after, an angry mother comes blitzing at them from the flank."
144	"一座供奉着几乎被遗忘的隐秘神祇的神龛，维护良好，供品看似新鲜，通过中等难度的宗教检定后，发现供品与神祇的偏好颇为契合。 A shrine to an obscure and almost forgotten deity/deities, but kept in good condition with seemingly fresh offerings, and after a successful moderate difficulty religion check, somewhat matching to their preferences."
145	"队伍遇到一条清澈潺潺的小溪，有踏脚石可过，河岸稳固，溪水浅得足以让轻载的马车涉水而过，且鱼儿丰盛！附近的一位德鲁伊对心怀善意、步履轻盈的过客颇为友好。 The party comes across a clear babbling stream, stepping stone crossing, good banks, shallow enough to ford a lightly loaded wagon, and with good fishing too! A nearby druid is somewhat friendly with any travelers passing through with good intentions and a light step upon the land."
146	"队伍遇到了一位独行的哥布林德鲁伊变形者及其收养的巨型狼群，包括幼崽。狼群看起来营养充足、健康。有50%的几率狼群一直在尾随队伍，只偶尔露出身影，希望利用旅行者惊扰猎物；否则，队伍会迅速遭遇横穿道路的狼群。其中一只巨型狼正拖着一具猎物，猎物被安置在由劈开的木头和藤蔓制成的拖架上。 The party comes across a lone goblin druid shapeshifter and his adopted giant wolf pack with pups. The pack seems well fed, healthy. There is a 50/50 chance the pack was tailing the party and visible only as brief glimpses, hoping to use the travelers to scare up game; otherwise, the party encounters the pack quickly crossing the road. The giant wolves have a carcass on a travois made of split wood and vines trailing behind one of the pack members."
147	"路边有人留下了一个大号软木塞封口的罐子，重达100磅。罐内困着一个微弱抗议的水元素，要求被释放（如果PC能听懂它的语言）。这个看起来粗糙但罕见的罐子被魔法附魔，能够容纳一个大型水元素，当说出命令词且罐子为空时，每周可尝试吸入此类生物（目标可通过中等难度的力量或敏捷豁免抵抗）。当前被困的水元素可与之交涉，但即使队伍已说服它自己是友善的，仍有50%的几率它会攻击任何释放它的人（至少在找到逃生路线之前）。 Someone has left a large corked jug on the side of the road, weighing 100 lbs. Inside it is a weakly protesting water elemental demanding to be let out (if the PCs can understand its language). The uncommon but crude looking jug is magically enchanted to contain an water elemental of up to large size, and when a command word is spoken and the jug is empty, once per week it can attempt to suck in such a creature (which can resist with a moderate DC STR or DEX save. The current occupant can be reasoned with, but there is a 50/50 chance it will attack anyone who sets it free (at least until it can find an escape route) even if the party has convinced it they are friendly."
148	"队伍遇到了一辆被毁坏的马车。车上的物品散落一地，拖拽的痕迹延伸至灌木丛中。如果队伍进行调查，他们会发现一只狮鹫正在啃食一头驮兽的骨头。 The party comes across a destroyed horse cart. The contents of the cart are strewn about, and drag marks lead into the bush. If the party investigates they find a griffin munching on the bones of a pack animal."
149	"走在队伍前方的人不慎掉入了猎人为捕捉野猪而设的陷阱坑。不久后，几头野猪也冲进了坑中。 Whoever is walking in front of the party accidently falls into a pit trap set by hunters to catch a wild boar. Shortly after, some wild boar charged right into the pit."
150	"当你穿越一片茂密的林地时，注意到头顶的树木上布满了密集的蛛网。蛛网间隐藏着数十只巨型蜘蛛，它们在树梢间无声地注视着队伍，发出轻微的咔嗒声。 As you travel through a heavily wooded area, you notice that the trees above you are filled with dense spider webs. Hidden amongst the webs are dozens of giant spiders, chittering and watching the party silently in the treetops."
151	"一只流浪狗开始远远跟随队伍。通过良好的动物驯养检定，狗会对队伍表现出友好态度。你可以收留它，或将其归还主人以获取奖励。 A stray dog begins to follow the party at a distance. With a good animal handling check, the dog will react to the party in a friendly manner. You can keep it or return it to its owner for a reward."
152	"一位孤独的野蛮人，手持巨弓，矗立在废弃的瞭望塔上，塔旁是队伍若不想浪费时间就必须通过的狭窄隘口。他朝下方大喊，要求他们支付过路费，否则只有死路一条。他为何自信能向一群武装且强大的冒险者收取过路费？因为他驯养了两只双足飞龙。 A lone barbarian, armed with a greatbow, stands atop an abandoned watchtower near a narrow pass that the party will have to go through if they don't want to waste time. He shouts down at them they must pay his toll or die. Why does he think he can enforce a toll against a party of armed and powerful adventurers? Because he has two tamed Wyverns."
153	"当太阳开始西沉时，一个幽灵出现在路上，指向森林深处。如果队伍跟随幽灵，它会引领他们深入森林，来到其早已死去的遗体旁，希望自己的遗骸得以安息。如果队伍从尸体上拿走任何东西，幽灵将会发动攻击。 As the sun is beginning to set, a ghost appears on the road, and points off into the forest. If the party follows the ghost, it leads them deep into the forest to its long dead body wishing to have its remains put to rest. If the party takes anything from the body, the ghost will attack."
154	"一棵倒下的树挡住了前方的路。当你靠近时，它颤抖着，抖落所有树叶。随后，那棵树站了起来，你短暂地看到树干上浮现出一张脸。它转身，摇摇晃晃地走开了。 A fallen tree blocks the road ahead. As you approach, it quivers, shaking all of its leaves. Then the tree gets up, and you briefly see a face on the trunk. It turns and unsteadily walks away."
155	"道路在此戛然而止，一棵大树、一块巨石或一个深坑横亘眼前，四周尽是看似无法通行的荒芜之地。实际上，这是一道精妙的幻象，需通过DC21的意志豁免才能识破。一旦越过障碍，一个极其刻薄的生物将无情嘲笑绕路者，并试图杀害或抢劫他们。附近有一位遭遇相同命运的NPC，若队伍助其跨越或绕过障碍，他将给予奖励。 The road literally ends, with a large tree, boulder, or hole filled with mostly uninteresting nothingness and seemingly impossible terrain on both sides. It is in actuality a superb illusion, with a DC21 Will save. Once past the obstacle, a powerfully petty creature will mercilessly mock anyone who went around, and then attempt to kill or rob them. An NPC nearby has suffered the same fate, and will reward the party for helping them across or around the obstacle."
156	"在道路左侧，矗立着一座看似雕像的物体。青苔和风化的痕迹覆盖其表面，除此之外它显得完好无损。一块墓碑静卧于其脚下（由DM决定碑上内容）。玩家若仔细检查雕像（调查DC 12），可发现其上刻有神秘的符文。进一步检查这些符文（相同的奥秘DC）会揭示，这座雕像实际上是一个铁卫或类似的构装体，它守护着这座坟墓，任何打扰都将导致构装体自动攻击打扰者，直至一方被摧毁。若试图修复它，构装体则会允许其行动。 On the left side of the road is what appears to be a statue. Moss and weathering cover its surface, but beyond that it looks pristine. A gravestone lies at its feet (DM's discretion as to what is on it.) Inspecting the statue (DC 12 Investigation) allows players to spot arcane runes. Inspecting the runes (same DC arcana) shows that the statue is actually a Iron Defender or similar construct which guards the grave, and disturbing it will cause the construct to automatically attack the creature who disturbed it until they or the construct are destroyed. If the creature attempts to fix it, the construct lets them."
157	"你注意到路旁一片土壤中有动静。突然，一个形似鼹鼠的小人从地里冒了出来。他从口袋里掏出一张地图和指南针，花了几分钟确定方向，然后消失回他的洞里。 You notice a movement in a patch of soil beside the road. Suddenly a small mole-like man appears out of the ground. He pulls a map and compass from his pocket. Takes a few minutes orientating himself. Then vanishes back down his hole."
158	"他们来到一个十字路口，正欲迈步穿越时，一匹马疾驰而过，随后更多马匹接踵而至，骑手们高声呐喊。不久，十字路口恢复平静，几位随后而来的旅人告诉玩家这是一场赛马，并欢迎他们加入。 They come across a crossroads, as they try and take their first steps across it a horse runs past them, and more follow. All have riders yelling at the top of their lungs. Eventually the crossroads calms down, and a few people traveling behind it inform the players it is a horse-race, and that they are welcome to join in."
159	"当你经过一片农田时，看到麦田上立着数个稻草人，但它们显然失职了，因为每只稻草人上都停满了乌鸦。突然，其中一只稻草人抽搐了一下，惊起一群血淋淋的鸟儿飞向天空。 As you travel past a farmer's field, you see a number of scarecrows above the wheat field, failing at their job as numerous crows sit atop each one. Then one of the scarecrows twitches, sending blood-soaked birds into the sky."
160	"你正穿越一片广阔的原野，路旁立着一间摇摇欲坠的小屋。当你走近时，一位老者从屋中走出，站在路中央示意你停下。他指向一块潦草写着的牌子，上面写着：“过路费，每人1银币”。 You are crossing a large open plane, a ramshackle hut stands beside the road as you approach an old man who comes out of the hut and stands in the middle of the road indicating that for you to stop. He points to a scrawled sign which says “Tol 1sp pr persun”."
161	"队伍遇到一个路边小贩在卖松鼠。“它们可是绝佳的宠物！”他说。一英里后，一伙强盗袭击了那些没至少买一只的人。 The party comes across a roadside vendor selling squirrels. ""They make Crackerjack Pets!"" he says. A mile down the road, a squad of bandits besets anyone who didn't buy at least one."
162	"一艘载满稀有珍贵飞鱼的飞艇及其船员在附近紧急迫降。飞艇受损，修复前无法起飞。与此同时，珍贵的货物正在迅速变质。 An airship filled with rare and valuable flying fish, and its crew, makes an emergency landing nearby. The vessel is damaged and until it is fixed it will not fly. Meanwhile, the valuable cargo is rapidly spoiling."
163	"一队遵循截然不同职业体系的冒险者路过，其中包括一名螳螂人角斗士、一名熔炉生炼金师、一名伊拉希冠军和一名以太吟诵者。 A team of fellow adventurers pass by that follow a radically different class system. There’s a thri-kreen gladiator, a forgeborn alchemist, an erathi champion, and an aetheryte cantor."
164	"一群林间嬉戏的萨提尔无视队伍，从旁经过。 A group of satyrs frolicking in the woods pass the party with no regard."
165	"队伍注意到路旁有几座雕像环绕着一辆旅行马车。走近后，他们发现其中一些雕像呈现出恐惧的姿态。一只蛇蜥、鸡蛇兽或其他适合队伍等级的怪物正在路旁灌木丛中享用一名受害者。由于它正忙于进食且已饱腹，队伍可以轻松通过而不受干扰，除非他们决定攻击它。 The party notices several statues in the path around a traveling wagon. As they approach closer they notice some of the statues are in poses with expressions of fear. A basilisk, cockatrice or any other appropriate monster to the party's level is feasting on one of the victims in the bushes just off the path. Since it is preoccupied and full, the party can easily pass it unmolested unless they decide to attack it."
166	"一只狗朝你们跑来，边跑边呜咽。当它到达你们身边时，你们看到它的脸侧和前腿上有血迹。它朝你们吠叫了几声，随后又跑回了附近的田野。 A dog comes running toward your group; whimpering as it does. As it reaches your group, you can see it has blood on the side of its face and front legs. Barking at you for a few moments, it bounds off back into the nearby field."
167	"一位老妇人坐在路边一块平坦的大石头上，轻轻拨动着膝上的扬琴。当你们走近时，她询问队伍是否能给她三天的口粮和水，以便她到达最近的城镇。如果你们同意，她可以为队伍施展以下法术之一作为报酬：探知、通晓传奇或生物定位。 An old lady sits atop a large flat stone at the side of the road, strumming softly on a dulcimer sat upon her lap. As you approach, she asks the party if they can spare her three days worth of rations and water in order for her to reach the nearest town. If they do, she can cast one of the following spells for the party as payment: Scrying, Legend Lore or Locate Creature."
168	"你注意到一个小村庄外一英里处，一棵孤树下放着一个木桶。你敏锐的目光发现密封的桶盖边缘有苍蝇飞舞；地面明显有木桶被滚动或拖拽的痕迹。如果队伍打开木桶，他们会发现一个年轻男子（约十几岁）肿胀的尸体以不自然的姿势塞在里面。桶底还残留着约两三英寸的葡萄酒；年轻男子似乎穿着送货公司的制服。 You notice a barrel sat in the shade of a lone tree a mile outside of a small village. Your keen eyes spot flies buzzing about the edge of the sealed lid; the ground shows clear signs of the barrel having been rolled or dragged to this spot. If the party opens the barrel, they find the bloated corpse of a young man (Late teens) wedged in an unnatural pose inside. The bottom of the barrel still has about two to three inches of wine sat in it; and the young man appears to be dressed in the livery of a delivery company."
169	"一支由众多身着深灰色长袍、头戴两侧带有大圆点状帽兜（形似猫头鹰头部）的宗教游行队伍。他们手持猫头鹰羽毛，六人共抬一个陶制镀金鼠笼（用于育肥食用睡鼠的栖息容器），笼中装有活睡鼠，以及数百只死鼠，鼠尾被串在游行队伍间的杆子上。若细查，这些啮齿动物体内藏有小宝石，每颗价值10x1d10金币。他们向你提供由小米、干果和蜂蜜制成的小蛋糕，形状可疑地酷似猫头鹰的食丸。 A religious procession of many people in dark gray robes and hoods with large rounded points on the sides reminiscent of an owl's head. They are carrying owl feathers, live dormice in a clay and gilt glirarium (container habitat for fattening dormice for eating) large enough that it takes six people to carry it, and several hundred dead rats and mice strung up by their tails on poles carried between the processionals. If inspected closely, the rodents have a small gem hidden inside worth 10x1d10 gp each. They offer you little cakes made of millet, dried fruit, and honey, that are shaped suspiciously like owl pellets."
170	"路边一座茅厕，里面“蜜桶”（用于排便）满溢着废物与散落硬币的混合物。这些硬币无疑是残酷的幻象，而那股恶臭更是难以言喻。 A roadside latrine with ""honey bucket"" (for defecating in) filled to the brim with a mixture of waste and random coins. The coins are a cruel illusion, surely, and the smell is bad beyond description."
171	"39名自称“星界之门旅者”的教徒，身着统一的新袍与鞋履，在路边小田野中排列成想象中的飞行船或魔法船的各岗位，每人手持该岗位船员应有的玩具道具：船舵、玩具大炮、玩具引擎等。他们提供饮品、小吃和其他点心，静候其变。 A cult of 39 individuals (calling themselves the ""Voyagers to the Astral Portal"") wearing new, matching robes and footwear have arranged themselves in a small field near the road in such a way that they each occupy one of the stations of an imaginary flying ship or spelljammer and each carry toy versions of the devices a crewmate occupying that station would have: A ship's wheel, toy cannons, toy engine, etc. They offer punch, snacks, and other libations while they wait."
172	"一名全副武装的冒险者躺在自己的血泊中，若不施以援手，必将失血而亡。他们已濒临绝境，只能喃喃自语：“我不能……就这样死去……”。若队伍成功救治，他们将感激涕零，并讲述自己在攀爬附近一棵树时不慎跌落，被树枝刺穿，伤势严重到连治疗药水都无法止血。他们勉强拖着自己来到路边，对队伍无比感激，会赠送一件魔法物品作为答谢，并渴望有朝一日能回报此恩。若他们不幸身亡，身上携带有数件魔法物品。 A heavily armed adventurer is laying in a pool of their own blood and will bleed to death if they are not aided, they are so far gone they will only mumble that ""I can't... die like this..."". If the party manages to heal them. They will thank the party and tell them that they were climbing a nearby tree when they fell and were impaled straight through on its branches, the wound was so bad their healing potion couldn't even stop the bleeding. They managed to drag themselves to the road and are incredibly thankful to the party, and will give a magical item as a reward and will gladly be looking to return the favor. If they die they have several magical items on their person."
173	"一名慌张的旅人跑向队伍，稍作停顿喘匀气后，他解释说自己的朋友被几只鹰身女妖抓走，并指引了队伍正确的方向。队伍无需长途跋涉，因为鹰身女妖在返回巢穴前便开始争吵，将俘虏遗弃在一座废弃谷仓的屋顶上，而她们则在附近的树上争执。如果队伍认为自己无法战胜所有鹰身女妖，可以悄悄地从屋顶救出俘虏。 A frantic traveler runs to the party after he pauses and catches his breath he explains his friend was picked up and carried off by several harpies and points the party in the right direction. The party doesn't have to travel far as the harpies didn't make it back to their roost before they began to argue, leaving their captive stranded on the roof of an abandoned barn as they argue atop some nearby trees. The party can rescue the captive from the roof if they are sneaky if they don't think they can win a fight against all the harpies."
174	"一位塞壬向队伍呼唤，她对于“文明人”充满疑问。她爱上了队伍途经的渔村中的一名男子，渴望“与他永远在一起”，并询问当她将他带走时，一个文明男子不可或缺之物是什么。显然，那位渔夫对她的存在一无所知，因为她从未接近过他。若队伍经过村庄时遇见他，他已是有妇之夫。若队伍质问塞壬，她会坚称“我的爱真挚永恒，我无疑更配与他相守”，并明确表示她将按计划绑架这名男子，以与他共度余生。 A siren calls out to the party as she has questions on ""Civil folk"". She loves a man in a fishing village just up the road on the party route. She wants to ""be with him forever"" and is asking what a man from civilization can't be without for when she whisks him away. It's very clear the fisherman does not even know of her existence as she has never approached him before. If the party meets the man when they pass through the village he is already married. If the party confronts the siren she states that ""My love is true and eternal, I definitely deserve to be with him more."" and makes it clear she is going to go with her plan to kidnap the man to be with her."
175	"精灵生物正在举办一场有酒有食的派对，欢迎任何旅者加入狂欢！派对成员加入后，精灵们邀请他们参与饮酒比赛和技巧游戏，并承诺每赢一次就能获得一些金币。然而，若他们输了，就必须给精灵们一些东西或承受一个诅咒（具体内容及精灵的邪恶程度由GM决定，他们可能直到有成员输掉比赛才提及惩罚）。 Fey creatures are having a party with drinks and food and welcome any travelers to join in the revelry! After the party joins, the fey welcome them to drinking contests and games of skill and promise that every win earns them some gold. However, if they lose, they have to give the fey something or suffer a curse, (up to the GM on what that is and how sinister the fey are, they might not mention the punishment on a loss until one of the party members loses)."
176	"当你沿路前行，头顶乌云密布，暴雨倾盆而下，冲刷着鹅卵石与泥土。雷电与狂风交织，模糊了前方的视线，你们正寻找营地，队伍却突然发现路边酒馆悬挂着一盏摇曳的遮光灯笼。走近时，你注意到门在夜风中摇摆不定，招牌仅靠一个铰链悬挂，烟囱不见一丝炊烟。接着，闪电照亮了门前台阶上那源源不断流淌的鲜血。 As you travel the road, a dark storm rages above you washing the cobblestones and dirt with a heavy fall. The lightning and wind conspire to reduce your ability to see up ahead as you try to find a campsite but your party soon spots a small flickering covered lantern attached to a roadside tavern. As you approach, you notice the door is swinging open in the night air. The sign hangs loose on one hinge and the chimney shows no sign of smoke. Then the lightning reveals the strong, steady flow of blood pouring down the front doorstep."
177	"你遇到了一座供奉“平安旅行守护神”的路边祭坛，上面摆满了食物、硬币和小饰品的供品。如果队伍向神龛献上捐赠/供品，他们可以掷一次d100并加上供品的价值（若献上多件，则取价值最高的一件）。若结果达到95或以上，他们将在接下来一周的旅途中获得一个小祝福，即在避免遭遇的所有感知检定上获得优势。 You come across a roadside altar dedicated to the 'Patron Saint of Safe Travels'; covered in small offerings of food items, coins and trinkets. Provided the party makes a donation/offering to the shrine, they may roll a d100 and add the value of their offering (single highest valued item if multiple are donated). If they score 95 or more, they receive a small blessing for their journeys for the week in the form of Advantage on all Perception rolls to avoid encounters."
178	"一位旅行的修补匠邀请队伍共进一餐。食物美味，若受到称赞，他将免费为他们修理物品。 A traveling tinkerer asks the party to share a meal with him. The food is good and, if complimented, will repair their things for free."
179	"有庞然大物一时遮蔽了阳光，但天空中却未见其踪。片刻之后，一具被啃食大半的巨大尸体坠落在路旁。它已饱餐，大概不会去追逐你的马匹。 Something massive blots out the sun for a moment, but nothing is found in the sky. Moments later, a large carcass crashes beside the road, mostly eaten. It has eaten so it probably won't go after your horses."
180	"一棵倒下的树挡住了道路，旧车辙痕迹从路旁延伸出去。在灌木丛中，发现了一辆马车的残骸，下面蜷缩着两具骷髅。 A fallen tree blocks the road with old cart tracks leading off of it. In the undergrowth, the remains of a cart are found with a pair of skeletons huddled beneath it."
181	"队伍在转过下一个弯道前听到许多猎犬的吠声。转过弯后，他们看到一座孤立的农场，一对老夫妇坐在路边的长椅上，周围有几只大狗。随着妇人一声令下，狗群安静下来，耐心地坐着。她以每只200金币的价格出售这些猎犬。这些狗训练有素，属性远超普通犬类，拥有惊人的感知力，不受睡眠或昏迷影响。即使因魔法沉睡咒而无法苏醒，它们仍能在感知到危险时吠叫和低吼。 The party hears a lot of hounds barking before they round the next turn in the road. On making the turn they see an isolated farm with an elderly couple sitting on a bench on the side of the road surrounded by several large dogs. On a word from the woman the dogs go silent and sit patiently. She is selling her hounds for 200gp each. They are very well trained beasts with stats far above those of other dogs with an amazing perception unaffected by sleep or being unconscious. If the dog is rendered unconscious from a magical sleeping spell it can't wake up from, it will still bark and growl when it senses danger."
182	"当队伍首次在远处地平线上望见目的地，展现在他们眼前的是一片崭新的景象。虽然前路尚远，或许还有挑战等待，但目的地终于触手可及，你懂吗？ The first time the party sees their destination on the horizon, spread out before them in a fresh vista. They still have a ways to go, and maybe some more challenges ahead, but the destination is finally real, you know?"
183	"边境附近的一座桥梁或渡口。一个天然的要塞，在誓言分裂之前。队伍在这文明的边缘首次遭遇粗野之徒。 A bridge or ferry crossing near the frontier. A natural choke point, before the oath splits. The party's first encounter with a rougher sort, out here on the edge of civilization."
184	"一个小女孩在森林里玩耍时，把她最心爱的娃娃落在了那儿。现在天黑了，没有娃娃她睡不着！她会非常担心的。毕竟，据说夜晚的森林闹鬼，她的娃娃可能会有危险！请立刻去帮她找回来！ A little girl was playing in the forest, and she left her favorite dolly there. Now it's night and she can't sleep without it! She will be too worried. After all, the forest is haunted at night, they say, and her dolly could be in trouble! Please get it for her right away!"
185	"前方路上，一群醉醺醺的矮人欢呼大笑，邀请你加入。他们运送的一个酒桶漏了，让所有麦酒白白浪费，简直是可耻，甚至是对丰收之神的侮辱。若队伍中的法师提出修复酒桶，矮人们会抱怨着赶走他们。若队伍参与庆祝并逗留过久，矮人们会变得沮丧，喋喋不休地谈论他们糟糕的人生选择和遗憾。 A group of drunk dwarves on the road ahead are cheering and laughing and invite you to join. One of the casks that they were transporting sprung a leak, and it would be a shame, nay, an insult to the gods of the harvest, to let all that ale go to waste. If the party wizard offers to cast mending on the cask, the grumbling dwarves shoo them away. If the party joins the festivities and stays for too long, the dwarves become depressed and talk non-stop about their poor life choices and regrets."
186	"一伙带着空瓶子和软木塞的讨厌地精横穿小径，追逐着一群尖叫的小精灵。 A nasty group of goblins carrying empty bottles and corks runs across the trail chasing a small group of screaming pixies."
187	"队伍遇到用古老语言书写的异常警示标志。翻译后，标志上写着：“此地非荣耀之所。我们在此埋葬了令我们厌恶之物。离开或死亡。”进一步调查，队伍将来到一片空地，地上布满以怪异角度突出的恐吓性石刺，中央是一座巨大的黑色玄武岩祭坛。试图挖掘或扰乱该地点会使队伍遭受辐射中毒。 The party encounters unusual warning signs in an ancient language. When translated the signs seem to say, ""This is not a place of honor. We buried something here that was repulsive to us. Leave or die."" Investigating further, the party will come to a clearing full of intimidating stone spikes protruding from the ground at odd angles, and a massive black basalt altar in the center. Attempting to dig or disturb the site gives the party radiation poisoning."
188	"小径上一张皱巴巴的羊皮纸。上面有些字迹，但不拾起并展开无法辨认。内书：“勿读爆裂符文！”随即，一颗酸液火球以读者为中心爆炸。 A crumpled piece of parchment on the trail. There's some writing on it but it's impossible to decipher without picking it up and opening it first. Inside are the words, ""Don't read explosive runes!"" An acid fireball immediately explodes, centered on the reader."
189	"队伍开始发现地上有最近挖掘的洞。随着他们接近一条附近的河流，这些洞变得越来越频繁。进一步调查后，在一个洞中，他们发现了一个因暴露而发狂、不断咒骂的矮人探矿者，他疯狂地重复着：“它在哪里？”这位老矿工对任何试图与他交流的行为都置之不理。 The party starts finding holes that were recently dug in the earth. The holes become more and more frequent as they approach a nearby river. Investigating further, in one of the holes is a cursing dwarven prospector, mad from exposure, and frantically repeating, ""where is it?"" The old miner ignores any attempts to communicate with him."
190	"一位陌生人请求帮助解读他们的地图。地图上没有队伍能识别的城市或路径，而是标注了水道、湿地和主要季节性气流。如果队伍成功识别出他们在地图上的位置，陌生人会给予奖励，随后化作一只鹤，继续他们的迁徙之旅。 A stranger asks for help reading their map. The map has no cities or paths the party can recognize, but instead the key markings are waterways, wetlands, and major seasonal air currents. If the party successfully identifies where on the map they are, the stranger rewards them, transforms into a crane and resumes their migration."
191	"队伍在主干道旁遇到一家客栈。店主正与一名税务官激烈争吵，店主认为这次加税是针对他个人的，怀疑征税的领主怀恨在心，企图逼他关门。而税务官则辩称，提高巡逻守卫的薪资本应带来客栈生意的增长。 The party comes across an inn just off the main road. The innkeeper is in the middle of a shouting argument with a tax collector. The innkeeper seems to think the tax hike is personal, that the taxing lord holds a grudge and is trying to drive him out of business. The tax collector is arguing that the intended rise in pay for guards patrolling the roads should mean an increase in business for the innkeeper."
192	"一个头发脏乱、衣衫褴褛、背着过大背包的人类小女孩，带着她同样邋遢的3岁弟弟，向队伍走来。为了换取保护和食物，女孩愿意提供侦察服务或协助队伍做饭、清洁、修补物品、洗衣等。（这对姐弟在村庄被烧毁、失去父母后，已独自在外漂泊两个月。女孩身上散发着魔法的气息，因为她是一位未经驯服的野魔法术士。） A human young girl with filthy hair, derelict clothes and a backpack too big for her, approaches the party together with her 3 year old brother, who looks equally scruffy. In exchange for protection and food, the girl offers her service as a scout or a helping hand for the party to cook meals, clean and mend things, wash clothes, etc. (The siblings are out and alone for two months now after their village burned down and they lost their parents. The girl has an aura of magic as she is an untamed wild magic sorceress.)"
193	"队伍遇到一位断腿的兽人和她的宠物座狼。两者都已精疲力尽，若提供食物和水，他们将感激不尽。这位兽人几周前在与熊搏斗时摔断了腿。哥布林发现了她，将她带到营地，假装提供帮助。在那里，她与一只受虐待的座狼成为朋友。当她意识到哥布林打算吃掉自己时，便逃了出来，并带走了座狼。她的口袋里藏有一则重要消息或物品。 The party encounters an orc with a broken leg and his pet worg. Both are exhausted and will be grateful when food and water is offered. The orc broke her leg while fighting a bear, weeks ago. Goblins found her and brought her to their camp, pretending to help her. There she befriended the worg, which was treated badly and as she realized the goblins were about to eat her, she broke out and took the worg with her. She carries an important message or item within her pockets."
194	"队伍听到奇怪的声音，在调查来源时，发现了一片古老的小型修道院遗迹，已被岁月侵蚀。遗迹内，一群骷髅和僵尸正跟随着一名身着死灵法师长袍的僵尸，绕着一块石头或祭坛在古亭下转圈。石头上及周围散落着铭文、符文、融化的蜡烛、一本书以及死灵法师的笔记。（死灵法师在此进行了一次失败的实验仪式，最终虽获得了梦寐以求的小型军队，但自己却变成了僵尸。）当亡灵察觉到队伍时，会立即发动攻击。 The party hears strange noises and as they investigate the source, they find old overgrown ruins of what must have been a small monastery in ancient times. Inside a strange parade of several skeletons and zombies are all following a third zombie in the robes of a necromancer, walking in circles around a stone or an altar under some kind of ancient gazebo. Some inscriptions, runes, melted candles, a book and some notes from the necromancer can be found on and around the stone. (The necromancer failed an experimental ritual here, which eventually gave him the small army he wanted, but turned himself into a zombie in the end.). When the undead are aware of the group, they will immediately attack."
195	"队伍发现一只哥布林的残骸和啃咬过的骨头散落在路上。它的双臂上附着着人工翅膀。翅膀是用皮条固定的，由木棍、线、焦油和多种鸟类的羽毛制成。奇怪的是，附近并没有高大的树木、山丘或悬崖。 The party finds the remains and gnawed off bones of a goblin splattered across the way. It has artificial wings attached to both arms. The wings were attached using leather strips and they are made out of wooden sticks, thread, tar and a lot of feathers of different birds. The strange thing is, there is no tall tree, hill or cliff nearby."
196	"走向一座桥时，队伍看到一只巨魔，他身旁站着两名全副武装的士兵。当队伍靠近时，巨魔叹息着站起来，用粗大的食指数了数人数。他多数了一个，然后从腰带上的大袋子里掏出相应数量的金币分发出去。他嘟囔着：“俺再也不白拿金币不交税了。”卫兵们微笑着向你们致意。 Walking towards a bridge, the group sees a troll and next to him two soldiers in full armor. As the party approaches, the troll rises with a sigh, uses his big index finger to count the group. He over-counts by one, then reaches into a big bag on his belt and hands out a number of gold coins accordingly. Doing so, he grumbles: “Me never take gold without paying tax again”. The guards greet you all with a smile."
197	"一只地精在树上高声尖叫，树下有一群狼试图接近她。如果队伍救下地精，她会非常感激，并交给队伍三支玻璃制成的箭矢（或弩矢）。这些是魔法箭矢。一旦箭矢击中未固定的大型或更小的物体或生物，射箭者与目标的位置会互换。无论结果如何，这样射出的箭矢会在撞击时破碎并失去此能力。 A gnome is screaming high up in a tree. Below her a pack of wolves try to get to her. If the party rescues the gnome, she will be very thankful and hand the party three arrows (or bolts) made of glass. These are magical arrows. Once the arrow hits a large or smaller object or creature that is not fastened to something else, the position of the shooter and the target are swapped. Regardless of this, an arrow shot this way breaks on impact and loses this ability."
198	"当队伍穿过一片茂盛的草地和花丛时，他们发现了一排两英尺高的石头。石头的数量与队伍成员相等，每块石头的图案和轮廓都隐约与一位队员相似。 As the group walks through a field of lush grass and flowers, they find a group of two feet high stones, placed in a row. The number of the stones equals the number of party members and the patterns and profiles of each stone resembles loosely one of the party members."
199	"队伍遇到一块告示牌，警告前方路径上有小型美杜莎和石化蜥蜴出没。路旁竖立着木桩，上面系着绳索。告示指示所有人应闭眼沿绳索前行一英里。（稍远的路段上，一伙欢快的强盗正等着那些愚蠢到相信这一切的旅人。） The party comes across a sign that informs them that the path ahead is crawled by smaller medusa and basilisk creatures. As far as they can see there are poles on the side of the road and ropes are knotted to them. According to the sign, everyone should close their eyes and walk along the ropes for the next mile. (A bit further down the road a merry band of bandits awaits all who are dumb enough to believe this.)"
200	"地面上一个巨大深邃的坑洞和一辆破碎的贸易马车残骸挡住了队伍的去路。成功通过DC 14的智力（调查）检定，可以发现并辨认出一名半身人的腿骨和靴子。这个坑洞是隧道网络的一部分，其中栖息着一只在附近游荡的布勒特兽。如果队伍能找到主洞穴并击败布勒特兽，可能会在那里发现一些有趣的物品。 A huge and deep hole in the ground and the broken remnants of a trading cart are blocking the path of the group. On a successful DC 14 Intelligence (investigation) check, the leg bones and boots of a halfling can be found and identified. The hole is part of a tunnel network inhabited by a bulette that roams the area. If the party can locate the main cave and defeat the bulette they may find some interesting items there."
