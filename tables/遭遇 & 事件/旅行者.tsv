1d100	旅行者
1	你遇到一位年长的绅士，他正沿着小路行走，身后跟着六只小狗。每只狗都系着一条小牵引绳，绳子连在他装满狗衣服和玩具的大背包上。过去几年里，这位男士训练这些狗表演各种把戏。他正从一个城镇游历到另一个城镇，试图成为一名著名的表演者。 You come across an older gentleman traveling down the path with a group of 6 small dogs walking behind him. He has them each on a small leash that is attached to his large backpack, filled with dog clothes and toys. Over the last few years, this man has trained these dogs to preform tricks. He is traveling from town to town to try and become a famous performer.
2	你经过一个身披红金色流动布袍的人，闭着双眼，正在表演一种极其缓慢的舞蹈。周围躺着几名昏迷的强盗。 You pass a person draped in flowing red and gold cloth, eyes closed and performing what looks like an incredibly slow dance. Around them are several unconscious bandits.
3	你看见一位老妇人和一个小女孩正缓缓向你的队伍走来。靠近后，你注意到老妇人其实是盲人，而女孩正在引导她。当你走近时，老妇人变得异常激动，并说出一连串话语，每一句都可视为预言。 You see an old woman with a young girl that is slowly moving towards your group. When you come closer you notice that the woman is actually blind, and the girl is guiding her. That woman gets intense when you come closer and gives away a series of phrases, each of those can be treated as a prophesy.
4	一对新婚夫妇正在前往森林中一处僻静小屋度蜜月。他们俩都迷人友善，但交谈越久，越明显感觉有些不对劲。尤其是，新郎在新娘意外身亡的情况下将获得巨大利益。 A pair of newlyweds on their honeymoon headed to a secluded cabin in the woods. They’re both charming and friendly, but the longer you talk to them, the clearer it is that something’s amiss. Specifically, it’s very clear that the groom has quite a lot to gain in the event of the bride’s untimely demise.
5	你踢到一块石头，它突然长出腿和爪子。仔细一看，原来是一只拳头大小的螃蟹伪装成石头。周围的所有石头也纷纷显露出螃蟹的真身，开始四散逃入草丛。如果抓住一只，它会在下次长休时消失。 You kick a rock, and it appears to grow legs and claws. On close inspection, it is a fist-sized crab disguised as a stone. All rocks in the immediate area reveal themselves to be crabs as well, which begin scattering into the grass. If one is captured, it disappears during the next long rest.
6	一只被拴在树上的狗。周围似乎没有其他人，但如果队伍带走了小狗，它的主人会试图找到它。 A dog leashed to a tree. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around, but if the party takes the pup its owner will try to find it.
7	一位矮小的女子推着车兜售用过的魔法护符。她的助手是个聋哑巨人，正拉着那辆车，每当有人靠近时就会咧嘴笑。她名叫塔比莎，说话轻声细语，颇为迷人。稍加打听便知，这对伙伴曾是共同冒险的朋友。 A short woman peddling used magical talismans out of a cart. Her assistant, a large deaf giant who is pulling said cart, grins whenever someone comes near. Her name is Tabitha and she’s rather charming in a soft-spoken way. A bit of prodding into the pair reveals they are both friends who once adventured together.
8	一位身着破旧长袍的男子，自称贵族，被邪恶的兄弟逐出家门。更可能是因贪婪愚蠢被赶出，但队伍可以自行发现真相，因为他不断提出更多请求。 A man in tattered robes who claims to be nobility who was forced from his home by a wicked sibling. More likely he was kicked out for being a greedy twit, but the party can learn that on their own time as he makes more and more requests.
9	两只狗头人叠在一起，披着旧斗篷。他们自称是著名的龙裔战士，似乎并不知道自己其实是两只狗头人。 Two kobolds standing on top of each other wearing an old cloak. They claim they are a famous dragonborn warrior, and they do not seem to know that they are actually two kobolds.
10	一对看似被遗弃的马匹。进一步检查发现它们仍佩戴着马具，似乎是被匆忙遗弃的。 A pair of horses, seemingly abandoned. A further inspection reveals they are still wearing riding tack and seemed to be abandoned in a hurry.
11	一个正在挖坟墓的人，旁边裹着某种尸体的裹尸布。 A person digging a grave, with a body of some sort in a shroud nearby.
12	一位穿着圣骑士盔甲的蜥蜴人。他拙劣地模仿着盔甲原主人的行为，假装自己是守序善良。或者，他在得到装备后改变了心意。无论如何，他现在很饿。 A lizard folk wearing a paladin’s armor. He poorly impersonates the paladin whose armor he has and pretends to be lawful good. Or maybe he’s had a change of heart after getting the gear. Either way, he’s hungry.
13	一位牧羊人带着十几只羊。他坚称所有的羊都是他的，并不时回头张望。 A shepherd with a dozen sheep. He keeps insisting that all the sheep are his and keeps looking over his shoulder.
14	一支十人路工队正在路中央移除树桩。其中四人手持弓箭，抱怨一位树精干扰工作。两人实际负责移除树桩，其余人则在“监督”。 A 10-man road crew removing a stump from the middle of the road. Four of the crew are armed with bows and complain about a dryad interfering with their job. Two are doing the actual work of removing the stump. The rest are ‘supervising’.
15	一场山洪阻断了部分道路。一位术士站在附近，提出以小额费用清理出一条干燥通道。术士言而有信，开辟了一条通往对岸的干燥水道。过河后，水道、山洪和术士都消失了。 A flash flood has blocked part of the road. A sorcerer is standing nearby offering to clear a dry path for a small fee. The sorcerer is true to their word and forms a dry channel to the other side. After crossing, the channel, the flood and the sorcerer disappear.
16	一只纯黑、异常高大的塔巴克西。她以DM选择的魔法物品换取一个有趣的故事。玩家必须讲述一个揭示其部分背景的故事，并通过DC 14的说服检定才能获得物品。每个玩家只能尝试一次，但每次失败，塔巴克西的兴趣都会减弱，DC增加2。如果塔巴克西的DC达到20，她会失望地收回提议并离开。 A pure black, unnaturally tall Tabaxi. She offers a magical item of the DMs choice in exchange for an interesting story. A player must offer a story that reveals a portion of their backstory and beat a DC 14 persuasion check to receive the item. Each player may attempt this once, but each time it is failed the Tabaxi’s interest wanes, increasing the DC by 2. If the Tabaxi’s DC reaches 20, she retracts, unimpressed, and leaves.
17	一个贫穷的小家庭，带着全部家当，正迁往新城镇。 A small and poor family, all their belongings in tow, moving to a new town.
18	一位售卖魔法矿物、水晶和粉尘的火蜥蜴巫师。他住在一间中央有巨大火堆的小屋里，大部分时间都在家中制作粉末并在火边进行手工艺。尽管他并不算最友善，但他聪明、强壮且乐于助人。他出售魔法与非魔法珠宝、烟火、法术和配方所需的组件与材料。 A Firenewt wizard who sells magic minerals, crystals and dusts. He lives in a hut with a large fire in the middle. He spends most of his days at home making powders and crafting near the fire. Although he is not the kindest, he is smart strong and helpful. He sells magical and non-magical jewelry, fireworks, components and ingredients for spells and recipes.
19	一只迷路后住在洞穴里的孤独沼泽蛙人。他自认为是洞穴的皇帝，手下有青蛙和蟾蜍作为仆从和守卫。 A lonely Bullywug who got lost and lives in a cave. He considers himself the emperor of the cave. He has other frogs and toads as minions and guards.
20	你看到两个骑马的身影：一个半身人和一个绿龙裔。他们小跑了一英里，直到在路边遇到一支戒备森严的华丽商队。原来，龙裔是一位参议员，正从外村返回。他们停下来喂马饮水，龙裔不小心把钥匙掉在了商队里。半身人是来自下一个城镇的锁匠。 You see two figures riding on horseback: a halfling and a green dragonborn. They trot along for about a mile until they come across a heavily guarded ornate caravan on the side of the road. As it turns out, the dragonborn is a senator, on his way back from a trip to the outer villages. They stopped to feed and water the horses, and the dragonborn accidentally dropped his keys in the caravan. The halfling is the locksmith from the next town over.
21	一只流浪狗，饥饿且肮脏，急需帮助。它戴着项圈，上面附着一张纸条，似乎是求救的信号！ A stray dog, hungry and dirty, desperately needing help. It has a collar with a note attached to it which seems to be a cry for help!
22	一支完全同职业但不同专长的敌对队伍。他们对同行有些令人厌烦，且正要去完成与队伍相同的任务/使命/目标。 A Rival party of the exact same class but different archetypes. They are a little obnoxious to their counterparts and are out to do the same quest/mission/thing the party is up to.
23	一位骑马旅行的黑骑士。可能被揭露为某种幻象，或是游荡的Boss型怪物。 A black knight traveling on horseback. Could be revealed to be some sort of illusion, or a wandering boss-type monster.
24	一个饥饿的乞丐，若得到帮助，日后会前来相助；若遭冷落，则会反其道而行之。 A hungry beggar, who if helped will come to their aid at a later date, if shunned will do the opposite.
25	一个疯狂的老头，自称知道一片充满魔法的秘密森林所在。你跟随他，但实际上他只是想带你回他家，因为自从妻子去世后他一直很孤独。 A crazy old man who claims to know where a secret forest full of magic is located. You follow him but he is actually just trying to take you back to his home because he has lonely ever since his wife died.
26	两位年长男性各自骑着一只巨型蜗牛。他们出售常见的魔法物品、附近洞穴系统的地图，并可能教导队伍如何增强药水效果。 Two older males each riding a giant snail. They sell common magic items, maps of nearby cave systems, and may teach the party how to enhance potions.
27	一个拥有锐利蓝眼的男子，除双眼外所有可见的肌肤都裹着布条。他身披破旧肮脏的贵族服饰，手持宗教典籍。他礼貌而专注，显然虔诚，嗓音低沉丝滑。细看之下，他的肌肤似被灼伤。他所到之处，厄运与死亡的预兆如影随形。 A man with piercing blue eyes, all visible flesh but his eyes wrapped in cloth bandages. Adorned in worn and dirty cloths of a nobleman and carrying a religious text. He is polite and intense obviously religious and with a deep silky voice. Upon closer inspection, his flesh appears burned. Omens of doom and death follow in his wake.
28	一队卫兵正将他们敬爱的伯爵夫人的遗体运回故乡。交谈中，卫兵们怀疑其中存在阴谋，请求冒险者们协助调查。 A group of guardsmen transporting the corpse of their beloved countess back to her homeland. Upon conversation, the guardsmen believe foul play was involved and ask the adventurers to investigate.
29	哈林，半身人厨师和他的员工们，全是半身人。他们四处旅行，寻找据说最美味的忧郁蘑菇。一位高大温和的半兽人是他们的保镖，绰号“欢乐”。 Harrin, the halfling Chef and his employees, all halflings. They travel in search of the Gloomy Mushroom, said to be the most delicious thing there is. A big and gentle half-orc is their bodyguard. His nickname is Joy.
30	一位盲人拄着棍子在路上蹒跚而行。如果队伍停下来与他交谈，他会谈起自己年轻时曾是这片地区最出色的强盗。问题在于，他失明后并未金盆洗手。他的同伙正藏匿在路旁的荒野中，用弹弓和短弓瞄准队伍准备射击。 A blind man stumbling along the road with a stick. If the party stop to talk to him, he will talk about how he was the best bandit in the area in his youth. Problem is he never quit when he lost his sight. His buddies are hiding in the wilderness on the side of the road and have been lining up shots on the party with their slingshots and short bows.
31	一支名为“龙之心”的巡回吟游诗人乐队，正处于他们“史上最大巡演”的中途，在世界多个城市演出。他们可能在不同的道路上反复出现。 A band of travelling bards called Heart of a Dragon on a middle of their ‘biggest tour ever’ where they are playing in multiple cities of the world. They could be a recurring encounter on different roads.
32	一群僧侣正前往他们教派的神殿朝圣，进行冥想和接受训练。 A group of monks on a pilgrimage to a shrine of their order to meditate and receive training.
33	一支巡回马戏团，其中一位表演者正在路边提供表演（塔罗牌占卜或未来事件的隐晦揭示），收费几枚硬币。 A travelling circus with a bunch of performers, one of whom is offering to perform their tricks (tarot readings or a future event cryptic reveal) at the side of the road for a couple of coin.
34	一位前往遥远圣地的宗教朝圣狂热者。这位朝圣者刚启程，充满干劲与愉快的传教热情。这是他首次朝圣，此前一直过着与世隔绝的生活。 A zealot on a religious pilgrimage to a far-off holy site. The pilgrim has only just started and is full of spunk and cheerful evangelism. This is the pilgrim’s first pilgrimage and up until now has led a very sheltered life.
35	来自“利安德的光明洗衣店与薰衣草浴室”的巫师利安德。他们在旅途中遭遇袭击，巫师和学徒都受了伤（学徒的伤口中毒，几乎肯定感染、坏疽，若没有牧师的帮助，很可能致命），他们的马车和装备也被偷走了。 The wizard Leander from Leander’s Luminous Launderette and Lavender Lavatory. They have been assaulted on their travels, both the wizard and their apprentice were injured (the apprentices wounds poisoned and almost surely infected, gangrenous, and without the help of a cleric; probably fatal.) and their wagon and gear stolen.
36	一伙伪装成朝圣苦行者的强盗，正前往附近寺庙。他们计划洗劫圣地并杀害庙内所有人。 A band of highwaymen posing as religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple. They plan to rob the holy site and kill everyone inside its walls.
37	一位农夫带着家人，三头牛、两只羊、五头猪和七只鹅跟在满载的马车后。一把摇摇欲坠的摇椅顶上绑着一位祖母。 A farmer and family in tow, with three oxen, two sheep, five pigs, and seven geese following the heavily laden cart. A single rocking chair is perched precariously on top with a grandmother strapped into it.
38	一队运气不佳的旅行艺人，他们有个小问题需要玩家解决。队伍中有一位初露头角的年轻故事大师，他必然会对玩家及其冒险故事深感兴趣。若能在此处施以援手或留下深刻印象，团队的事迹将在下一座大城市中传为佳话。 A travelling troupe of down on their luck performers with a small problem that the players can solve. In their troupe is a budding young master storyteller who is sure to be deeply interested in the players and their stories. Help or Impress them here, and tales of the team’s exploits precede them in the next big city.
39	一个被愚弄的农夫，他买了一只装在袋子里的猫（被告知那是只小猪）。农夫沮丧不已，花光了所有积蓄，只希望能改变命运。 A dimwitted farmer who was sold a cat in a bag (and had been told it was a piglet). The farmer is despondent and has spent every penny they had in the hopes of changing their fortune.
40	一位驾着老马和半坏马车的商贩，陷在了泥泞的车辙中。实际上，这位商贩是乔装旅行的间谍，马车故意陷入泥中是为了制造接触的借口。或者，商贩所载货物明显是从当地权贵或宗教团体处偷来的，玩家可能知情也可能不知情，而商贩愿意不惜一切代价避免被抓。 A peddler with an old horse and half broken cart who has gotten stuck in a muddy rut. The peddler is actually a spy travelling under cover and the wagon was deliberately stuck to provide an excuse to make contact. Alternatively, the goods the peddler is carrying are obviously stolen from a local power or religious group and the players may or may not know about it happening, and the peddler is willing to do a lot of things to not be caught.
41	一位不称职的冒险者，不接受拒绝，计划前往玩家们要去的地方。这位冒险者很友好，但似乎过于努力了。 An incompetent adventurer that won’t take no for answer and plans to head wherever the players are going. The adventurer is friendly but seems to be trying too hard.
42	一位骑士独自或带着极少的随从旅行。出于某种原因，他被迫卖掉了心爱的战马，或因其重伤而不得不放弃。又或者，这位骑士其实是位正在履行宗教苦行的圣武士，发誓在一个月零一天内不骑马或乘车。 A knight travelling with a very small, or nonexistent retinue. The knight has been forced to sell his prized warhorse for some reason, or have it knackered due to severe injury. Alternatively, the knight is actually a Paladin doing religious penance and has vowed not to ride a horse or cart for the entirety of one month and one day.
43	一群满身泥土的矮人矿工从路边走来，提出用非常珍贵的宝石换取一些麦酒和食物（“不要干粮，要真正的食物！”）。他们刚发现了一处巨大的宝石矿藏，想要庆祝一下。希望你们随身带了些食物。 A pack of dirt-covered Dwarf miners’ approach from off the road, offering to trade very valuable gems for some ale and food (‘not trail rations, real food!’). They have just struck upon a massive gem deposit and wish to celebrate. Hope you have some with you.
44	一位瘦削的猎人走近，请求你的帮助。他显然饥饿难耐，声称追踪一只枭熊到了附近洞穴，若你能协助击杀，将能养活他家人一个月。 A hunter approaches, asking for your aid. He is gaunt, obviously hungry. He says he has tracked an Owlbear to a nearby cave, and if you can help him kill it, it will feed his family for a month.
45	你看见路中央躺着一具男尸，年纪不过十八九岁，喉咙被割开。若你停下查看，很快会看到一队搜索者从树林中朝你走来，他们正在寻找此人。你不该离他太近。 You see a man’s corpse in the middle of the road. A young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen. His throat has been cut. If you stop to examine the body, you quickly see a search party coming toward you from the wood. They are looking for the man. And you should not be so close to him.
46	你注意到一个精灵瘫靠在树上，浑身是血，濒临死亡。他透露自己是信使，被强盗伏击。他告诉你他们没找到他携带的信件，信藏在他的靴子里。他请求你替他送信给几天路程外的Threader’s Hollow村的一位名叫Ella Corwyn的女士。若读信，内容是她儿子Dennis的简单消息，他正在精灵那里学习魔法。若送达，Ella会为你的队伍提供丰盛的羊肉炖汤和美味自制饼干，并让你们在她的谷仓过夜，与她的冠军猪Josephine为伴。 You notice an elf slumped against a tree, covered in blood and on the verge of death. He reveals that he is a courier and was ambushed by bandits. He tells you that they didn’t find the message he carries; it is hidden inside his boot. He asks you to deliver the message for him to a woman named Ella Corwyn in the village of Threader’s Hollow, a few days ride out of your way. If read, it is a simple message from her son, Dennis, who is training in wizardry with the elves. If delivered, Ella will feed your group (hearty lamb stew with delicious homemade biscuits) and offer shelter in her barn, alongside her prize pig Josephine.
47	一只穿着背心、戴着圆顶礼帽的熊正从一辆停在路边的牛车上售卖精工制作的大师级乐器。他名叫威廉·贝尔顿三世爵士。他不会说话，但能理解并用粉笔在黑板上一笔一划地拼写出通用语的回复。若有人试图偷窃，他会毫不犹豫地以凶暴熊的姿态攻击。一群不同种族的吟游诗人在附近的空地上即兴演奏，听起来非常棒。若被问及，他们会将音质归功于乐器的品质。任何精通乐器且钱包鼓鼓的人必须通过DC 10的意志检定，否则会感到必须购买一件。价格高昂（2倍），但工艺似乎物有所值。车侧用华丽的花体字醒目地写着：“精工细作之顶级乐器，威廉·贝尔顿三世爵士，店主”。 A bear wearing a vest and derby hat is selling expertly crafted Masterwork musical instruments from an ox-drawn cart hitched to a tree by the side of the road. His name is Sir William Bearington III. He does not speak but can understand and scratch out misspelled replies on a chalkboard in Common. Should you attempt to steal from him, he will attack without hesitation, as a Dire Bear. A small collection of bards of various races have formed an impromptu jam session in a clearing nearby. They sound great, and if asked, they attribute the sound to the quality of the instruments. Anyone with a proficiency in a musical instrument and enough gold in their purse must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or feel compelled to buy one. Prices are high (2x), but the craftsmanship appears to be worth it. A flamboyantly painted sign on the side of the cart in bold calligraphy reads: “Musickyl Innstrumynts of Fynest Make, Experrtly Crafftyd by Sir Wm. Bearington III, Proprytor”
48	三个脏兮兮的农民正驾着一辆异常华丽的马车驶过。他们紧张地朝你们的队伍微笑挥手。通过DC 18的观察检定，可以发现马车侧面有一道血迹。 A trio of dirty peasants is riding past on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at your group. A DC 18 spot check will notice a smear of blood on the side of the carriage.
49	你遇到了一群大约十几个年轻人类男子。他们手持长矛，身穿皮甲，似乎试图引起你的注意。如果遭到攻击，他们会立即逃跑。如果与之交谈，他们自称是士兵并要求征税。如果拒绝，他们会挥舞长矛，谈论国王的愤怒，但一有暴力迹象便会逃跑。实际上，他们是懦夫和逃兵，正试图南逃。 You come upon a group of a dozen or so young human men. They carry spears and wear leather armor. They appear to be trying to get your attention. If attacked, they immediately flee. If spoken with, they claim to be soldiers and demand a tax. If refused, they brandish their spears and talk about the wrath of the King but will flee at the first sign of violence. In reality, they are cowards and deserters, trying to make their way South.
50	一名男子乞求帮助，声称“被强盗抢劫了。好心人，能载我一程去一天路程外的村子吗？”一旦有机会，他会试图偷走值钱的东西并骑上你的马逃跑。如果觉得合适，他会先捅你一刀。 A man begs for help. He has been “robbed by bandits. Please, kind strangers, a ride into the village that’s just a day’s travel away?” At the earliest opportunity, he will attempt to steal something of value and ride away on your horse. If it seems like a good idea, he will stab you first.
51	一对年迈的夫妇拦下你，请求你留下一些银币作为对他们儿子的纪念，二十年前他就在此地遇害。 A very elderly couple flags you down. They ask you to leave some silver as a remembrance for their son, who was killed on this very spot twenty years ago.
52	一个巨人坐在空地上哭泣，他的泪水声在空旷处回荡。他的妻子最近被冒险者杀害，看到你们的武器他会暴怒。如果你能安抚他，他会自称乌吉尔，并恳求你为他的妻子伸张正义，杀死兽人野蛮人“勇者卡纳克”、人类法师“黑手阿尔多”、矮人牧师“山中的托多克”和地精盗贼“斯温德洛·达芬顿·丁格尔”。 A Giant sits in the clearing, he is weeping. The sounds of his tears echo across the open space. His wife was recently killed by adventurers, and he will fly into a rage upon seeing your weapons. If you manage to calm him down, he introduces himself as Urgirr and will beg you to find justice for his wife by killing the Orc Barbarian “Karnak the Bold”, the Human Wizard “Aldo Blackhand”, the Dwarf Cleric “Tordok of the Mountain”, and the Gnome Rogue “Swindlow Duffington Dingle”.
53	你遇到一个极其年老的矮人，赤身裸体如初生时一般，站在路中央要求支付10金币的过路费。他手持长棍，自称是道路之王。幸好，他长长的白胡子遮住了他皱巴巴的下体。 You come upon an impossibly elderly dwarf, naked as the day he was born, standing in the middle of the road demanding a 10 gp toll be paid. He wields a quarterstaff and proclaims himself to be the King of the Road. Thankfully, his long white beard shields his wrinkled nethers from your view.
54	一名长弓手向所有挑战者发起狩猎比赛，赌注100金币。谁能在一小时内猎杀最多鸟类，谁就能赢得奖金。 A longbowman challenges all takers to a hunting contest. A 100 gold bet. Whosoever can kill the most birds in one hour wins the purse.
55	莫蒂·梅内考姆，一位四处旅行的侏儒炼金术士，在这个意想不到的地方开设了店铺。他的价格略高于平均水平，但他喜欢笑话，如果有人能逗他笑，他会愿意讨价还价。他的儿子曼尼，一位手持长剑和钢盾的魁梧战士，正盯着你。 Morty Mennecaum, a traveling gnome alchemist has set up shop in this unlikely location. His prices are a bit above average, but he loves a joke and will negotiate if someone can make him laugh. His son, Manny, a burly fighter with a Longsword and steel shield, eyes you.
56	一个幽灵在你路上徘徊，他是格雷戈尔·詹托斯。他请求你给附近镇上的妻子阿莉娅带个口信：“那不是意外。凯尔瓦尔剖开我是为了接近你。别相信他。”当你找到阿莉娅时，她已与凯尔瓦尔结婚九年，并育有一女。他们是个幸福的家庭。格雷戈尔十二年前去世，他在镇上并不受欢迎，因酗酒和殴打阿莉娅而声名狼藉。 A ghost hovers in your path. He is Gregor Jantos. He asks you to deliver a message to his wife Alya in a nearby town: “It was no accident. Kelvar cut me open to get to you. Don’t trust him.” When you find Alya, she has been married to Kelvar for nine years and they have a daughter together. They are quite the happy family. Gregor died twelve years ago, and he wasn’t well-liked in town. He had a reputation for getting drunk and beating on Alya.
57	一个十二岁男孩盘腿坐在路边一块显得格格不入的巨石上，头戴一圈草绳。若有人搭话，他会睁开眼睛，点头示意并显得专注，但不会开口说话。他通过摇头来回答是非问题。他已立下沉默誓言，正前往成为僧侣的路上。若恳求帮助，他能带你前往他的寺院，在那里你可以住宿、用餐并修行长达一周。 A twelve-year-old boy sits cross-legged atop a boulder that seems out of place near this stretch of road. He wears a circlet of rope around his head. If spoken to, he will open his eyes and acknowledge you and appear to pay attention, but he will not speak. He will answer yes or no questions with shakes of his head. He has taken a vow of silence and is on his way to becoming a Monk. If begged for assistance, he can show you to his monastery where you may sleep, eat, and train for up to a week.
58	一位镇民（加尔格）正与一位旅行商人（菲尼亚斯）争吵。他声称自己购买了50瓶神奇药水，但商人给他的箱子里只有46瓶。商人辩称顾客一定是喝掉了四瓶药水，因为他“有系统”。这场争执涉及8枚金币。 A townsman (Garg) is arguing with a traveling salesman (Phineas). He claims that he paid for 50 miracle cures, but the crate the salesman gave him only contained 46. The salesman claims that the customer must have drunk four of the doses of the cure because he “has a system”. The dispute is over 8 gold pieces.
59	一名旅行商人驾着马车从你身边疾驰而过，半个村庄的人手持斧头和草叉在后面追赶。他们声称他利用他们，将装在瓶中的彩色威士忌卖给他们，并声称能治愈矿工热病。如果你抓住商人，他会辩称这是诚实的工作，为绝望的疾病贩卖希望。如果你成功威吓他（DC 15），他会归还镇上75%的钱。如果你在威吓检定中超过他的DC 10或更多，他会全部归还。 A traveling salesman blows past you on a cart. He is being chased by half a village who run after with axes and pitchforks. They claim he took advantage of them by selling them colored whiskey in a vial and saying it would cure Miner’s Fever. If you catch the salesman, he claims it’s honest work, selling people hope for an otherwise hopeless disease. He will give back 75% of the town’s money if you Intimidate him (DC 15). If you beat his Intimidate DC by 10 or more, he gives it all back.
60	一队皇家卫兵正接近。六名壮汉，至少有些受伤，守护着一个看似铁制的坚固箱子。他们行进迅速。他们表示能立刻看出你们是值得信赖的人，并邀请你们加入他们，将极其贵重的货物运送给国王——这将使你们偏离原定路线数周——承诺为你们的努力提供微薄报酬。若你们拒绝，他们再次强调货物的无比珍贵，并解释说自己因旅途劳顿而疲惫虚弱，易受强盗袭击。若强行打开箱子（通过杀死守卫并撬开复杂的锁），里面是来自另一个王国的信件——一份和平条约。 A patrol of royal guards is approaching. Six stout men, at least somewhat injured, guarding what seems to be an iron strongbox. They are traveling quickly. They say that they can tell right away that you are trustworthy folk, and they ask you to join them in transporting their incredibly valuable cargo to the King–which is several weeks travel out of your way–promising a small reward for the effort. Should you refuse, they again stress how incredibly valuable their cargo is, and explain that they are tired and weak from their journey, and vulnerable to bandits. If the strongbox is opened (by killing the guards and picking a difficult lock), it contains a letter from another kingdom–a peace treaty.
61	四个不超过八九岁的小孩自豪地拦住了你们的队伍。他们是冒险英雄，想加入你们的队伍，去消灭可恶的巨怪，斩杀可怕的巨龙，并且想熬夜到多晚都行。 A group of four small children, no more than eight or nine years old, proudly stops your group. They are adventuring heroes and want to join your party. To kill nasty trolls, and slay horrible dragons, and stay up as late as they want.
62	一群手持临时武器和火把的镇民正朝附近城市进发，他们宣称要讨伐当地一位小领主，因其税收过高。若发生冲突，他们必遭屠杀。 A crowd of townsfolk equipped with makeshift weapons and torches is marching towards a nearby city. They proclaim that they are going to do battle with a minor local lord because his taxes are too high. If there is a fight, they will certainly be slaughtered.
63	三位年长妇女组成的小团体，身着家纺衣物和脏污的披肩。其中一位脚部肿胀，走路一瘸一拐；另一位嘴唇肿胀感染，说话时流口水；第三位手指扭曲感染，无法抓握物品。她们分别手持剪刀、装有加工好的亚麻纤维的袋子以及纺锤和纺锤杆。她们实则是伪装成凡人的精灵，拥有奇异力量、预言洞察力及古怪的伦理观。或者，她们是动机可疑的女巫/巫婆，但遵循一条道德准则：对她们表示应有尊重的人将得到“奖赏”。 A small group of three older women, dressed in homespun and dirty shawls. One woman has a swollen foot and walks with a limp. One has a swollen and infected lip and drools when she speaks. A third has a twisted and infected finger, rendering her unable to grasp anything. One wields a set of shears, one a sack of prepared flax fiber, and a third a distaff and spindle. They are fey in disguise with strange power, prophetic foresight, and strange ethics. Alternatively, they are witches/hags with questionable motives, but a moral code of ‘rewarding’ those who show them respect they feel they deserve.
64	一位穿着荒诞装束的词源学家，手持滑稽的大捕虫网，穿着短裤、遮阳帽、袜子和凉鞋。他们请求帮助捕捉只有他们才能看到的东西。 An etymologist in absurd getup with a comedically large bug net, short shorts, pith helmet, socks and sandals. They ask for assistance catching something only they can see.
65	未闻其人，先闻其声。接近路弯时，两个声音大声互相抱怨：“你说你知道路怎么走！”“我说是往东，是你觉得买地图浪费钱！”路边倒下的树干上坐着一位女巨人，她肩上坐着一位女半身人，正递过酒囊给同伴。 You hear them before you see them. As you approach a bend in the road you hear two voices, each loudly complaining about the other. “You said you knew where we were going!” “I said that it was East, you’re the one who said a map was a waste of money!” A female Goliath sits on a fallen tree at the side of the road. A female Halfling is perched on her shoulders passing a wineskin to her companion.
66	一个看似普通的男子在路边向队伍打招呼。他会主要与佩戴最多魔法珠宝的队员交谈。经过一番尴尬的对话后，他会迅速试图偷走珠宝并逃跑。当队伍追赶他时，他会变成一条古老的铜龙飞走，队伍将无法追踪他。之后，如果队伍在附近城市调查犯罪活动，他们可能会听说一个非法的魔法黑市。这条铜龙是黑市的主谋，在被对峙时会归还物品。 A seemingly normal looking man who greets the party on the road. He will mostly address the party member with the most magic jewelry. After some awkward conversation he will quickly make an attempt to steal the jewelry and run. When the party persuses him he turns into an ancient copper dragon and flies off. They won’t be able to track him. Later if the party is investigating crimes in a nearby city, they might catch word of an illegal magic black market. The copper dragon is the kingpin of the operation and will give the items back when confronted.
67	天色渐暗，大雨倾盆。你看见对面走来一个男人，手持沉重的雨伞，身披厚重大衣。只要他还在视线之内，雨就一直下着，而他一旦消失，雨立刻停了。 The sky darkens and it begins to rain heavily. You see a man coming the other way, carrying a heavy umbrella and wearing a heavy coat. It rains for as long as the man is in sight, and then immediately clears.
68	七名矮人矿工向你道早安，他们正前往矿井工作。 Seven dwarven miners bid you good day as they go to work in their mine.
69	一位愿意以40金币出售其地区地图副本的制图师经过。拥有此地图的队伍在该地图区域内每日可额外行进1d4英里。 A cartographer passes who is willing to sell a copy of his map of the area for 40gp. With this map the party can travel at an additional 1d4 miles per day of travel within the area of the map.
70	你遇到了一位漫游的贡德（或其他类似工艺之神）信徒，他愿意修复任何破损或损坏的装备。 You find a wandering disciple of Gond (or any other similar god of crafting) who offers to repair any broken or damaged equipment.
71	一位受伤的年轻骑士躺在路边。他从恶龙手中拯救公主的使命再次失败。他曾与几位冒险者和雇佣兵同行，但如今他是唯一的幸存者。 A wounded young knight laying down on the side of the road. His quest to save the princess from the dragon had failed, again. He went with a few adventurers and mercenaries, but he was the only survivor left.
72	一位占卜师坐在路边的马车上，似乎以马车为营生。车上挂着一块牌子，写着简单占卜收费1银币，复杂占卜则需1金币。（若被要求证明能力，她会施展一个简单的德鲁伊小法术，展示明天的天气，并让他们明天回来验证。此处可进行洞察检定。）若有队员求卜，DM可自行决定占卜内容，或预言他们即将遭遇死亡。 A fortune teller sits on the side of the road in a cart that she seems to operate her business out of. There’s a sign on it that explains that a simple fortune is 1 silver, but a more intricate fortune is 1 gold. (If asked to prove her talent, she performs a simple druidcraft cantrip showing tomorrow’s weather and tells them to come back tomorrow to see her if she’s correct. This may be a good place for an insight check). If any party member gets a fortune told, the DM can choose the fortune, or she can foretell imminent death in their path.
73	一个地精正趴在一辆古怪的马车底下，摆弄着机械装置，嘴里咒骂个不停。他拒绝帮助，坚称你只会碍事。 A gnome is underneath a curious wagon, fiddling with a mechanical apparatus and swearing up a storm. He refuses help and insists you would just get in his way.
74	三位高等精灵智者正在互相争执，争论一本关于奥术的书籍的解读。如果未被问候或打招呼，队伍对他们来说是完全不可见的。 Three high-elven sages can be seen bickering among themselves, arguing over the interpretations of a certain book on Arcana. The party is completely invisible to them if the sages are not addressed/greeted.
75	一个双眼缠着绷带、一只靴子略大于另一只、手上装着某种机械义肢的男子，被一只似自然又非自然的猎犬牵引着。当被问及那只明显不自然的狗时，他只是说：“我相信他。是他带我离开那里的。” A man with bandages over his eyes, a boot slightly larger than its mate, and a sort of mechanical prosthetic hand being led a pseudo natural hound. When questioned about the clearly unnatural dog, he just says ‘I trust him. He led me back out of there’.
76	一位拥有小餐馆/酒馆的厨师在一条人迹罕至的路边开店，纳闷为何从未有顾客光临。 A chef with a small restaurant/tavern sets up on a rarely traveled roadside wondering why he never gets any customers.
77	一个衣衫褴褛的老人坐在路边，会讨要零钱来喂他的狗。如果你与他们相处足够久，狗会显露出德鲁伊的身份，这对搭档试图抢劫你。 A tattered old man sitting by the roadside will ask for change to help feed his dog. If you spend enough time with them, the dog reveals itself to be a druid and the pair attempt to rob you.
78	一辆由两头牛拉着的车上坐着一位精灵和一位矮人。两人都穿着昂贵而花哨的衣服。矮人正抽着陶土烟斗，膝上放着一把装饰华丽的连弩。他们向队伍兜售商品，展示车上收集的武器和盔甲；都是二手货，有些明显使用过，盔甲凹陷，刀刃有缺口，还沾着血迹。其中不乏几件好货，价格也公道。若有魔法物品，商贩们并不知情，会当作普通物品出售。这些角色通过从战场上捡拾战利品赚了不少钱，大部分来自最近两位贵族军队的冲突。若你决定，精灵可能在袖子里藏着一两根魔杖以防不测。 An elf and a dwarf on a cart pulled by a couple of oxen. Both wear expensive, gaudy clothes. The dwarf is puffing on a clay pipe and has an ornate repeating crossbow on his lap. They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard. These characters make good money from looting battlefields, most of this haul from a recent clash between two nobles’ armies. At your discretion the elf may have a wand or two up his sleeve in event of trouble.
79	一位妇女和六个小孩乘坐牛车接近。他们看起来脏兮兮、疲惫且忧虑，但如果队伍友好，母亲会分享她的故事：父亲抛弃了家庭，他们再也负担不起以前的家。母亲提出，如果队伍愿意护送他们到下一个村庄，她会给出一枚金币。传闻该地区有狼群，他们害怕在天黑前无法到达镇上。 A woman and six small children approach in an ox-drawn wagon. They appear dirty, tired and apprehensive, but if the party is friendly the mother will share her story: the father has run out on his family, and they could no longer afford to live in their previous home. The mother offers the party a single gold coin if they would accompany them to the next village. Rumor has it there are wolves in the area, and they are scared they won’t make it to town before nightfall.
80	一位游吟诗人和他的爱人骑着驴子走来。他提出为你演奏一曲以换取一枚硬币。他是你听过的最糟糕的歌手。他收下你的硬币，继续沿着道路前行。 A traveling minstrel and his lover approach on a donkey. He offers to play you a tune for a coin. He is the worst singer you have ever heard. He takes your coin and carries on down the road.
81	一座巨大的魔法石屋。石屋对所有魔法及锋刃武器免疫。屋内是一位强大而友善的巫师的家，他拥有众多魔法物品和药剂。他开设了一家商店，以略低于手册价格出售魔法物品。他以实际价值的110%收购稀有魔法物品，以90%的价格收购普通魔法物品。白天似乎有许多人前来，而夜晚则无人问津。这是因为他会在睡梦中说话。在任何一天，有1/3的几率他会在睡梦中施放d4个法术。 A large magic stone hut. The hut is immune to all magic as well as edged weapons. Inside is the home of a helpful powerful Wizard with many magic items and potions. He has made a shop which he sells him magic for slightly lower prices that the Handbook’s. He will buy any rare magic for 110% of its actual cost. He buys magic at 90% of its actual cost. Lots of people seem to come by in the day and no one seems to be there at night. This is because he talks in his sleep. On any given day, there is a 1/3 chance that he will use d4 spells in his sleep.
82	两位著名剑客正在决斗。其中一人过去可能作弊，未来也可能计划作弊。他们的追随者要么试图阻止战斗并寻求帮助，要么在讨论条件并寻找中立仲裁者。 Two famous swordsmen, having a duel. One may or may not have cheated in the past and may or may not be planning to cheat in the future. Their followers are attempting to either stop the fight and seeking help or are discussing terms and seeking a neutral arbitrator.
83	一只孤独的破跟鞋子，它被赋予了生命，性格鲜明，总在抱怨“我的脚都累坏了！”。这可能是某个巫师通过魔法在戏弄你。 A single, lonely shoe with a busted heel. The shoe is animated, and has a personality, always complaining that ‘My dogs are tired!’. It may or may not be a wizard pulling a trick on you via enchantment.
84	一位旅行艺术家在附近的田野里支起画布，正在绘制野花。只需5铜币，他就能为你或你的任何队友在纸上创作一幅炭笔画。若支付5金币，他会停下手中的花卉画作，跟随队伍为其中一人绘制肖像，直至完成。若被问及作品，他会兴奋地展示自己的素描本，里面满是沿途遇到的各种人物肖像和素描。他自称从不忘记任何面孔，甚至可以根据你提供的细节，以10铜币的价格绘制某人画像。即使描述不够精准，他的作品也出奇地准确。 A traveling artist has set up a canvas in a nearby field and is painting some wildflowers. For 5 copper pieces, he will make a charcoal drawing on paper for you or any of your party members. For 5 gold pieces, he will stop his flower painting and spend time following the party painting a portrait of one of you until he is finished. If prompted about his work, he will get excited and show you his sketchbook. It’s full of various drawings and portraits of people he’s passed on the road. He says he never forgets a face and will even draw someone according to details given by you for 10 copper pieces. He’s surprisingly accurate even if you aren’t the best at describing things.
85	一个醉醺醺的胖萨提尔，主要忙于打听下一场派对在哪里。 A portly drunken satyr mostly preoccupied with finding out where the next party is.
86	一个自大的精灵蠢货，花了400多年时间掌握了一种已在当地灭绝的狼的嚎叫。几乎无需挑衅就会展示嚎叫，并期待你为之惊叹。 A pompous fool of an elf who has spent over 400 years mastering the call of a species of wolf which has since gone extinct in the area. Will demonstrate the howl with almost no provocation and expects you to be impressed.
87	一位身穿红边白底大衣的胖硕老哥利亚，拖着一个装满礼物的大袋子 A portly old goliath in a red coat with white trim dragging a big bag full of presents
88	手持盒子的角魔，提议让你看一眼盒内之物，代价是你的灵魂。 Horned devil with a box in his hands. Offers to allow you to take a look inside in exchange for your soul.
89	一位灰发斑驳的圣武士，手持巨剑，漂浮的盾牌正与两名隐形追猎者展开殊死搏斗。 A grizzled paladin with a great sword and a floating shield in a desperate fight with two invisible stalkers.
90	一个沉睡的菲尔伯格，被他的宠物大象用象鼻卷着，大象尽职地沿着道路前行，礼貌地让路给其他行人。 Firbolg sleeping, held in the trunk of his pet elephant who dutifully trundles down the road, stepping politely aside to allow for traffic.
91	三名被指派去洗劫附近文明的丘陵巨人。他们迷路了，想向队伍问路。 Three hill giants who have been assigned to sack a nearby civilization. They’re lost and want directions from the party.
92	一位隐士，自豪地向路人伸出双臂，手中拿着一只脚跟有洞的旧袜子。他大声喊道：“看看我的袜子！它是不是很棒？！这袜子在我家传了好几代，从未湿过！它既不神奇也不特别，但简单来说，它就是有史以来最好的袜子！” A hermit, proudly extending his arms towards bypassers, holding a single old sock with a hole on the heel. Loudly exclaiming ‘Look at my sock! Isn’t it wonderful?! This sock has been in my family for generations and never once been wet! It’s not magical nor special, but it is, simply put, the best sock ever made!’
93	一位神情阴郁的恶魔领主推着手推车，车里躺着一位醉醺醺、兴高采烈的矮人，正大声唱着“墙上86瓶啤酒！”若被打断，矮人牧师会大声打嗝，皱眉耸肩，然后从“井里十亿只甲虫”重新开始唱，咯咯笑着入睡。见状，恶魔领主坐下开始哭泣。 A glum-looking demon lord pulling a wheelbarrow in which is lying a very drunk, very happy dwarf loudly singing ’86 bottles of beer on the wall!’ If interrupted, the cleric burps loudly, frowns and then shrugs, starting again at ‘1 billion beetles of butt in the well’ before giggling and falling asleep. At this the demon lord sits down and begins weeping.
94	一位老人和他的四个哑巴儿子，全都衣衫褴褛，其中一个手持一根大拐杖。实际上，老人是一位巨魔法师的头颅，他的“儿子们”则是他的四肢，被变形为一群人类。老人会要求分享队伍的口粮，而他的儿子们会一直吃，直到食物被吃光。 An old man and his four mute sons, all dressed in rags, one carrying a large walking stick. In truth, the old man is the head of a giant mage, and his ‘sons’ are his limbs, polymorphed into a group of humans. The old man will ask for a share of the party’s rations, and his sons will eat and eat until no food is left.
95	一个气味古怪的地精，斗篷下藏着各种魔法物品，包括一块能让你隐身六秒的小怀表、指尖点着蜡烛的手，点燃后能麻痹魅力值14或以上的100英尺内所有生物，以及一本空白小册子，看似对见到它的所有生物极为重要，实则毫无用处。 An oddly smelling gnome with various magic items hidden under his cloak such as a small pocket watch that turns you invisible for six seconds, a hand with candles on its fingertips that when lit paralyze every creature with 14 or more charisma in a 100ft radius, and a blank booklet that does nothing but looks extremely important to all creatures who see it.
96	安格玛·剑行者——人类骑士——棕色头发与蓝眼睛，她自豪地带着一侧脸上的疤痕。她总是有点迟到，有点古怪，马厩里养着一只奥特雅格作为宠物。尽管剑术娴熟，她因房子闹鬼而搬离了家。 Angmar Bladewalker – human knight – Brown hair and blue eyes, she proudly wears a scar across one side of her face. She is always a bit late, a bit eccentric, and has an otuyagh in the stables that she raises as a pet. Deft with a blade though. She moved out of her house because it was haunted.
97	赞恩·德雷克——高等精灵诗人——他有着非常长且卷曲的棕色头发，左侧剃光，棕色眼睛，粗糙的金色皮肤。他面容柔和，留着短须。他总是大声而戏剧性地说话。此外，他知道一位天使的真名。 Zane Drake – High Elf poet – He has very long, curled, brown hair shaved on the left side and brown eyes, with rough golden skin. He has a soft, typical face with a short moustache. He speaks loudly and dramatically at all times. In addition, he knows the true name of an angel.
98	艾莱斯·法拉瓦尔——半精灵商人——她有着长长的卷曲黑发和绿色眼睛。她总是轻声细语，且非常虔诚。她的故乡被一场风暴摧毁。 Ayleth Falavaul – Half-Elf merchant – She has long, curled, dyed black hair and green eyes. She speaks quietly at all times and is deeply religious. Her homeland was destroyed by a storm.
99	多兰·雷霆掘者——矮人贵族——永远不耐烦的多兰总是在大喊大叫。他有一头短短的金发和长长的胡须，每天早上都由妻子编成辫子。一位老朋友想要向他复仇。 Doran Thunderdelver – Dwarf noble – Endlessly impatient, Doran is always shouting about something or other. He has short blond hair and a long beard, which his wife braids every morning. An old friend wants revenge on him.
100	波拉斯——龙裔法师——多疑且易怒，他非常关心当地镇民。一个名叫卡瓦尔的男子偷走了他的一本法术书。 Porath – Dragonborn wizard – Suspicious and prone to growling, he cares deeply about the local townsfolk. A man named Kavarr stole one of his spell books.
