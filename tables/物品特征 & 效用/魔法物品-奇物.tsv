2	奥术奶酪 奥术奶酪并非真正的奶酪，而是一种源自奥术的黄色泡沫，凝结成勉强可食用的物质。食用奥术奶酪的角色需进行体质检定，若失败，体质减少1点。同时还需进行智力检定，若失败，智力增加1点（上限18）。一份奥术奶酪可满足一天的食物需求。 Arcane Chees Arcane cheese is not real cheese. It is a yellowish froth of arcane origin condensed into a remotely edible substance. A character eating arcane cheese must make a CON check. If failed, their CON decreases by 1. They must also make an INT check. If failed, their INT increases by 1 (maximum 18). One serving also counts as enough food for one day.
3	占星铁砧 这枚符文铁砧可将制作魔法护甲和武器所需时间减半，并允许任何等级的奥术施法者制造此类物品。 Astrological Anvil This runic anvil halves the time required to create magic armour and weapons, and allows arcane casters of any level to create such items.
4	守护者帽 这顶棕色的尖顶帽上有一张脸，能够看、听、说，且足够聪明，可在休息和睡眠时担任警戒。 Guardian Hat This brown pointed hat has a face on it, which can see, hear, and speak, and is intelligent enough to be set as a watch during rest and sleep.

8	学习魔杖 这根奥术魔杖能够从卷轴中吸取奥术法术。法术会从卷轴中移除并储存在魔杖内，最多可储存13个法术。奥术施法者可激活魔杖释放其中储存的任一法术。魔杖内储存的重复法术有可能引发魔法事故，规则与奥术施法者准备重复法术时相同。 Learning Wand This arcane wand can suck in arcane spells from scrolls. The spell is removed from the scroll and becomes stored inside the wand. It can store up to 13 spells. An arcane caster can activate the wand to release any one of the spells stored inside.

10	紫色力量帽：这顶尖顶毡帽拥有宽大的帽檐。它允许奥术施法者额外准备一个法术。该法术实际上储存在帽子内，因此施法者必须佩戴帽子才能施展该法术。 Purple Hat of Power This felt pointed hat has a very large brim. It allows an arcane caster to prepare an extra spell. The spell is actually stored inside the hat, so the magic-user must be wearing it in order to cast that spell.
11	统御之戒 佩戴者能感知50英尺内的任何魔法戒指。佩戴者可通过集中注意力，使范围内一枚戒指的效果失效。 Ruling Ring The wearer of this ring is aware of any magic ring within 50’. the wearer can concentrate and nullify the effects of one ring within range.

16	法术陷阱 这个苹果大小的机械黄铜装置有一定概率捕捉正在施放的法术。当20英尺内的奥术施法者施法时，他们必须进行法术豁免。若失败，法术被吸入陷阱中，且无效果。每次法术陷阱吸入一个法术，都有爆炸的风险，爆炸概率等于当前已捕获法术数量的d100。爆炸的法术陷阱效果等同于火球术，造成每捕获一个法术1d6的伤害，最高10d6。 Spell Trap This apple-sized mechanical brass device has a chance to entrap spells being cast. When an arcane caster within 20’ casts a spell, they must save vs spell. If they fail, the spell is sucked inside the trap and has no effect. Everytime the spell trap sucks a spell in, it has a chance of exploding, equal to the number of spells it has trapped so far, on a d100. An exploding spell trap has the same effect of a fire ball spell, inflicting 1d6 damage per number of trapped spells, up to 10d6.
17	破法剪刀 角色可用这对木制剪刀打断正在施放的魔法。施法者需在可见可闻范围内。若使用剪刀者先于施法者行动，法术自动中断并引发魔法事故；若施法者先行动，则可通过法术豁免来无视剪刀效果。使用剪刀的回合内，角色无法移动或执行其他动作。每次使用后，剪刀有等同于法术等级的d100几率损坏。 Spellbreaking Scissors A character can use these wooden scissors to break a spell while it is being cast. The caster must be within hearing distance and in sight. If the character using the scissors has won initiative over the caster, the spell is automatically disrupted and creates a Magical Mishap. If the caster has won initiative, they can make a save vs spell to ignore the scissors’ effect. A character using the scissors cannot move or do other actions during the round. Every time the scissors are used they have a chance of breaking, equal to the disrupted spell level on a d100.
18	法术封印墨水：奥术施法者可用此墨水在角色身上纹刻一个魔法印记，使该角色永久免疫施法者已知的一个法术。获得纹身会导致永久失去1点生命值。 Spellseal Ink This ink can be used by an arcane caster to tattoo one magic seal on a character. The character becomes permanently immune to one spell, which must be known by the arcane caster. Receiving the tattoo causes the permanent loss of 1hp.
19	星辰指引帽 这顶蓝色毛毡尖帽饰有金色星辰。一位奥术施法者在进行新法术的魔法研究时佩戴它，可将失败几率和所需时间减半。 Starry Hat of Guidance This blue felt pointed hat is decorated with golden stars. An arcane caster wearing it during magical research for new spells halves the chance of failure and time required.
