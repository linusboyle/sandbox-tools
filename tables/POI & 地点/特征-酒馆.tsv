1d100	特征-酒馆
1	这家酒馆要求所有客人戴上面具，是个略显阴暗但又不失雅致的地方。许多顾客是寻求刺激的城市精英，但价格适中，使得工薪阶层也能融入其中。 This tavern requires all guests to wear masks. It is a somewhat shady, but otherwise classy place . Much of the clientele is the city elite looking for excitement, but the prices allow a working class crowd for them to blend in with.
2	这家酒馆堪称上流社会的典范。他们不允许任何未穿合适贵族服饰的人进入，尤其是那些肮脏的冒险者。一旦入内，所有的沙发和座椅都是用最上等的天鹅绒制成。他们出售的葡萄酒和菜肴无可挑剔，但价格极其昂贵。 This tavern is the very definition of upper class. They won't let anyone inside that isn't wearing the appropriate noble clothing, ESPECIALLY not dirty adventurers. Once inside, all of the couches and seats are made with the finest velvet. The wines and dishes they have for sale are immaculate but incredibly expensive.
3	酒馆地板上交错着齐膝高的平台，方便半身人侍者倒酒和清理桌面。不过对于高个子来说容易绊倒，所以请小心脚下。 Knee high platforms crisscross the tavern floor so that the Halfling servers can easily fill mugs and clear tables. It does make for a tripping hazard for tall folk, so watch your step.
4	这家酒馆的公共区域设有开放式房间引入阳光，并拥有一个郁郁葱葱的花园，里面种满了来自该地区精心打理的美丽植物。 The common area in this tavern has an open room to let sunlight in and a lush garden filled with beautifully tended plants from all around the region.
5	这家酒馆的天花板被绘成夜空的模样，嵌入了微小的巫光颗粒，让“星辰”闪烁着迷人的光芒。 The ceiling of this tavern is painted to look like the night sky. Small motes of witch light are embedded into the ceiling, giving the 'stars' a shimmering look to them.
6	酒吧由一位女术士及其学徒经营。隐形仆从在桌间传递订单，而学徒们则照料着装有魔法增强酒液的酒桶。若使用正确的钥匙和仪式，酒馆中的许多门和通道可用作传送门。 The bar is managed by a sorceress and her apprentices. Unseen servants carry orders between tables while the apprentices tend to the kegs of magically enhanced brew. Many of the doors and passageways of the tavern may be used as portals if the proper keys and rituals are performed.
7	这家酒馆有一项名为“魔药畅饮”的挑战。每周结束时，酒馆老板在清理时在酒吧周围找到的所有散落和遗失的药剂都会被倒入一小桶麦酒中。挑战在于喝下一整品脱这种魔法麦酒。饮用麦酒会导致各种随机效果：从你的头发全部脱落，到背上长出巨大的蝙蝠翅膀。 This tavern has a challenge called the 'Potion Chug'. At the end of the week, all of the loose and lost potions that the tavernkeeper finds around the bar during clean up is all poured into a small barrel of ale. The challenge is to drink a whole pint of the magical ale. Drinking the ale causes all sorts of random effects: anything from all your hair falling out to growing large bat wings on your back.
8	这家酒馆收集了人们战死时所戴的头盔。吧台周围陈列着数十顶凹陷、裂开和生锈的头盔。 This tavern collects helmets that people have been killed in. Around the bar, there are dozens and dozens of dented, split, and rusted helmets.
9	这家酒吧以其烈酒闻名。偶尔会有醉醺醺的狂欢者进来要求喝“锤子酿”，这种酒必定会让他们昏迷1d4小时。锤子酿价格极其昂贵，女服务员要求提前付款，包括小费！ The bar is known for its strong drinks. Occasionally, a drunken reveler will come in demanding 'hammerbrew', which will invariably knock them out for 1d4 hours. Hammerbrew is incredibly expensive and the barmaid demands to be paid in advance, including tip!
10	客栈角落里矗立着一座用木头精雕细琢的精灵雕像。岁月在雕像上积满了灰尘，但卓越的工艺依然清晰可见。店主回忆说，在一个风雨交加的夜晚，他正在关窗时，发现这座雕像躺在客栈附近的灌木丛中。他无从知晓雕像的来历，也不知道它究竟代表着谁。 In the corner of the inn lies an extraordinarily carved statue of an elf made from wood. The statue has collected dust over the years, but the incredible craftsmanship is apparent. The tavernkeeper says that one stormy night, he was closing the windows and noticed the statue lying in the brush near the tavern. He has no idea where it came from, or who the statue is representing.
11	酒馆老板是个鬼鬼祟祟的老矮人，总是东张西望，扫视整个房间。偶尔有人看见他一边擦拭吧台，一边对着吧台说话。每当壁炉里的火快要熄灭时，他会用手抚过壁炉架，低声安慰它，随后整栋建筑会颤抖、吱嘎作响，仿佛在挣扎，最后发出一声呻吟般的呼气，火焰便重新燃起。有人认为这酒馆本身是活的。 The proprietor of the tavern is a shifty old dwarf, always looking over his shoulder and scanning the room. Occasionally he is spotted speaking to the bar itself as he wipes down the counter top. Whenever the fire in the hearth is dying, he runs his hand over the mantle, whispers to it in a comforting manner before the entire building shudders, creaks, strains, before letting out a groaning exhale and the fire is revitalized. Some believe the tavern itself is living.
12	这家颇为昂贵的高档酒馆供应数十种传统陶炉菜肴。所有菜品均由陶土魔像酒保亲手制作，直接从其胸内嵌入的炉灶中取出。 This rather expensive, high-end tavern serves dozens of traditional clay oven dishes. All of these are hand-made by the clay golem bartender, straight from the oven embedded in their chest.
13	这家酒馆招募邪教徒。店主是黑暗邪教中的高级成员，酒馆的功能是吸纳新成员。店主依靠魔法和敏锐的洞察力，识别出那些容易被组织教化的顾客。若受到威胁，店主会拉响绳索，敲响警钟召唤援兵。 This tavern inducts cultists. The owner of this tavern is a high-ranking officer within a dark cult, and the function of this tavern is to recruit new members. The owner relies on both magic and keen insight to identify customers with the right predisposition to be indoctrinated in the organization. If threatened, the owner will pull a rope, ringing a bell that will summon reinforcements.
14	酒馆已对神经兮兮的冒险者忍无可忍。所有木制装饰都被烧成焦黑，一块大招牌警示任何魔法使用将导致被该地区所有场所封禁。人们常因看似使用魔法而被赶出，即便他们并未施法。 The tavern has had enough of twitchy adventurers. All wood fittings have been burned to a blackened tone, and a large sign suggests any magic usage will lead to a ban from all establishments in the area. People are often thrown out for appearing to use magic, even if they aren’t.
15	这家酒馆天花板高耸，悬挂着一尊粗糙雕刻的真人大小的美人鱼雕像，位于吧台上方。这位几乎全裸的女性身上装饰着超过二十只因未付账单而被砍下的焦黑干瘪的顾客之手。 This tavern has a high ceiling adorned with a crudely carved life-sized mermaid suspended over the bar. This nearly nude woman is adorned with more than a score of blackened and shriveled severed hands of patrons who did not pay their bills.
16	这家酒馆是一个危险团伙的聚集地。当地人都避而远之，但旅行者有时会误入其中。里面的恶棍们正默默评估着队伍的自卫能力。 This tavern is the hangout of a dangerous gang. The locals all stay away, but travelers sometimes blunder in by mistake. The ruffians inside are silently estimating the party’s ability to defend itself.
17	酒保和服务女郎们都在左肩上披着鲜艳的绿金色花卉肩带，斜跨至右髋系紧。几位佩戴类似肩带的顾客可免费饮酒。 The Bartender and serving girls all wear bright green and gold floral sashes over their left shoulders, draped across and tied at the right hip. A few patrons wearing similar sashes drink for free.
18	这家酒馆极为重视隐私与保密。初次进入时，你会被分发面具与斗篷，并被引领至无窗的私密房间。顾客间的对话皆与外界隔绝，确保私密无虞。 This tavern takes privacy and secrecy very seriously. When you first enter the tavern, you are given a mask and cloak and escorted to a private room with no windows. Patron's conversations are all kept private from the outside world.
19	这家酒馆壁炉上方的墙上挂着一具奇怪的骨架。没人知道它属于哪种生物或从何而来，但它已经在那里很久了，以至于顾客们只是接受并庆祝它的存在。 There is some strange skeleton mounted to the wall above the fireplace of this tavern. Nobody knows what kind of creature it belongs to or where it came from, but it's been there for so long that patrons just accept and celebrate its existence.
20	酒吧坐落于码头，设有一个下层区域，顾客可以在此垂钓，将双脚浸入水中，小鱼无害地轻啄皮肤。厨师会免费为你煎炸任何捕获的鱼！ The bar is situated on a pier, and has a lower level where patrons can fish and let their feet sit in the water, where small fish nibble on the skin harmlessly. The cook will fry up anything you catch for free!
21	这家酒馆是调查者的掩护。一个致力于铲除腐败的团体专门建造了这家酒馆，以获取针对贵族和政府官员的证据。酒馆秘密由退休的执法人员和记者经营，内部布满了侦察装置和隐蔽的观察室。冒险者可能会被赶走，或被请求协助监视。 This tavern is a front for investigators. A group dedicated to wiping out corruption built this tavern specifically to acquire evidence against nobles and government officials. The tavern is secretly staffed by retired law enforcement officers and journalists, and is replete with scrying devices and hidden observation chambers. Adventurers might be shooed away, or asked to aid in surveillance.
22	这家豪华酒馆装饰着各种黑暗哥特风格的饰品，是各类不三不四之人的常聚之地，实际上却是某个有组织犯罪团伙的掩护所。 This opulent tavern is adorned with all manner of dark and gothic decorations. A favored haunt for all manner of unsavory characters, this tavern is actually a front for an organized crime ring.
23	这家酒馆位于城镇较贫困的区域，但异常奢华的吊灯、维护良好且光亮的吧台，以及高品质的酒水和娱乐设施，使其成为城市贵族的热门藏身之处（或许他们资助了这家店）。 The tavern is located in one of the poorer parts of the town but uncharacteristically lavish chandeliers, well-kept and polished countertops, and high-quality alcohol and entertainment make it a popular hideout for the city’s nobility (perhaps they fund the establishment).
24	这家酒馆实际上是一个非法的地下酒吧。在禁酒令全面实施的情况下，许多酒馆被迫转入地下。由非法私酿酒和走私酒水供应，这种新型酒馆——地下酒吧，已在王国各地风靡一时。在地下酒吧里，派对通宵达旦，只要当局不突然突袭。 The tavern is actually an illegal speakeasy. With prohibition laws in full effect many taverns have been forced to go underground. Supplied by illegal moonshine and smuggled liquor, this new style of tavern, the speakeasy, has become all the rage throughout the kingdom. Within a speakeasy, the party goes all night long, so long as the authorities don't spring a surprise raid.
25	这家酒馆有几幅魔法画作，能够与人交谈对话。画中人物总是对外界发生的事情充满好奇。 This tavern has a number of magical paintings that can talk to people and hold conversations. The people in the paintings are always excited to hear about what's happening in the outside world.
26	这家酒馆的缺陷正被幻术所掩盖。为了给一位富有的买家留下深刻印象，店主请来了一位巫师朋友，用魔法遮掩了这家店众多、有时甚至危险的缺陷。幻象掩盖了地板上的破洞、害虫、破旧家具和难看的菜肴。 This tavern’s flaws are being concealed by illusions. Desperate to impress a wealthy buyer, the owner has enlisted a wizard friend in covering up the establishment’s many, sometimes dangerous, deficiencies. Glamers conceal holes in the floor, vermin, shabby furniture, and hideous dishes.
27	酒馆后面有个可疑的炼金术士，出售安眠药水和其他药剂，供人购买并下在饮品中。酒馆老板对此人知情，但因分享其部分利润而未采取行动。 A shady alchemist behind the tavern will sell sleeping potions and other concoctions for people to buy and spike drinks with. The tavern owner is aware of this man, but isn't doing anything about him due to him sharing some of his profits.
28	这家酒馆以航海为主题。每张“桌子”实际上是一艘木船，顾客们需爬进去。墙上挂满了渔网、舵轮和鲸鱼骨。 This tavern has a nautical theme. Every 'table' is actually a wooden boat that the patrons climb into. Nets, ship wheels, and whale bones line the walls of the tavern.
29	靠墙固定的长凳确保每位顾客背后都有保护。吧台旁没有凳子或座位。在这家店里，没人会遭到背刺。 Benches mounted to the walls assure that every patron has a protected back. There are no stools or seats at the bar. No one will be getting backstabbed at this establishment.
30	酒吧由退休的“冒险者”经营，他们大多伤痕累累，缺指少眼或肢体残缺。同样饱经风霜的冒险者可免费畅饮，只需向众人讲述一段冒险故事作为回报。 The bar is staffed with retired 'adventurers'. All are significantly mauled, scarred and most missing fingers, eyes, or limbs. Similarly battered adventurers will drink for free, in return for a tale to the general audience.
31	这家酒馆的老板痴迷于收集世界各地新奇有趣的小玩意。酒馆的墙壁和角落装饰着玻璃柜，里面保护着被收购来的闪亮小饰品和装饰品。老板愿意出售或交换任何一件小饰品。 The tavernkeeper at this tavern is obsessed with collecting new and exciting trinkets from around the world. The walls and corners of this tavern are adorned with glass cases that protect shiny trinkets and baubles that have been procured. The tavernkeeper is willing to sell or trade any of the trinkets.
32	吧台后挂着一幅精美的挂毯。传闻图案中绣有秘密符号和文字。有人说它是藏宝图。有人说是强大法术的魔法咒语。还有人声称它隐藏着秘密社团的密码。老板娘说她只是觉得它很漂亮。 An elaborate tapestry hangs behind the bar. Rumor has it that there are secret symbols and writings embroidered into the pattern. Some say it’s a treasure map. Others say it’s magical incantations for powerful spells. And others claim it hides the password for a secret society. The barkeep says she just thought it was pretty.
33	这家酒馆围绕温泉而建，宽敞的中心区域设有一个露天温泉池，供沐浴者放松。内部则有一个小池，供厨师用于低温慢煮。这里的住宿条件奢华，拥有名厨、远道而来的品酒师、才华横溢的吟游诗人、丝绸床单，以及与之相称的价格。 This tavern is built around a hot spring. The central area of this spacious tavern includes an open-air spring where bathers relax in a large pool. Inside, a smaller pool is used by the cooks for low-tech sous vide. Accommodations at this location are extravagant, with renowned chefs, far-traveled sommeliers, talented bards, silk sheets, and prices to match.
34	柔和的魔法音乐弥漫整个房间，略高于客人的喧闹声。然而，每位顾客都听到不同的曲调或乐器声，以契合他们的心情或偏好。 Soft, magical music fills the room, just over the din of the occupants. Each patron, however, hears a different tune/instrument to fit their mood/preference.
35	这家酒馆弥漫着腌鱼的臭味。店主亲自腌制这些鱼，并将它们装在密封的陶罐里卖给旅人。陶罐几乎无法掩盖这股气味。 This tavern reeks of pickled fish. The owner cures them himself and sells them to travelers in sealed clay pots. The pots do little to mask the odor.
36	这家酒馆里满是老鼠，但并不令人反感。这些老鼠属于酒馆老板，她为每一只都起了名字。老鼠会在酒馆里四处游荡，有时还会爬上顾客的腿，试图偷吃他们的食物。 This tavern is filled with rats but not in a bad way. These rats belong to the tavernkeeper and she has named every one of them. The rats will wander around the tavern, sometimes climbing up the leg of a patron to try and get to their meals.
37	外表看似普通，但酒吧内部吧台和桌椅均由同一棵树雕刻而成，树根深植于酒吧，经过数百年精心弯曲和压平，成为吧台和桌椅。这棵树依然存活并生长，偶尔会冒出几片新叶。 While normal appearing from the outside, inside the bar and tables are all molded from one tree, which is rooted in the bar and has carefully been bent and flattened over hundreds of years to serve as a bar and tables. The tree is still alive and growing, with a leaf sprouting here and there.
38	这家酒馆以多种菌类菜肴为特色。酒馆附近有一处洞穴系统，酒馆老板在那里采集并种植各种蘑菇。 This tavern specializes in a number of fungi-based dishes. There is a cave system located a short distance from the tavern where the tavernkeeper collects and grows a variety of mushrooms.
39	这家酒馆是知识分子的聚集地。当玩家们抵达时，酒馆空无一人，但逐渐有穿长袍的顾客涌入。这里是几位著名贤者和学者偏爱的饮酒之地，充斥着激烈的学术辩论与讨论，他们不容忍任何形式的喧闹。 This tavern is an intellectual hub. This tavern is empty when the PCs arrive, but slowly begins to fill up with robed patrons. This is the favored watering hole of several prominent sages and scholars. This is a site of intense intellectual debate and discussion, and they will not tolerate rowdiness of any kind.
40	一把魔法鲁特琴为酒馆提供音乐伴奏，曲目丰富但有一根弦走调。酒馆老板讨厌吟游诗人，因他的爱人曾被一位吟游诗人拐走。 An enchanted lute provides a musical accompaniment to the tavern. It has a respectable repertoire, but one string is out of tune. The tavern owner despises bards, having his lover swept off by one.
41	杯子被施了魔法，当你打响指时会自动续满。 The mugs are enchanted to refill themselves when you snap your fingers.
42	这家酒馆极为重视隐私与隐秘。初次进入时，你会被分发面具和斗篷，并被引导至一间无窗的私密房间。然而，客人们所不知的是，酒馆老板有办法监听每个房间，并计划敲诈城中许多权贵。 This tavern takes privacy and secrecy very seriously. When you first enter the tavern, you are given a mask and cloak and escorted to a private room with no windows. What the patrons don't know is that the tavernkeeper has ways of listening in to each of the rooms and is planning to blackmail many of the city's most powerful people.
43	一家沙龙风格的酒馆，前面设有一个适中的舞台，所有顾客都能看到。每周五晚上，一位星界预言家会讲述她的预言。 A saloon style tavern with a modest stage up front where all the patrons can see. On Friday nights, an astral seer tells of her prophecies.
44	一只填充的观察者从这家酒馆中央的天花板上悬挂下来。它并非真正的观察者，而是用皮革和颜料制成，但挂得足够高，没人能近距离细看。 A taxidermy Beholder hangs from the ceiling in the center of this tavern. It’s not a real Beholder. It was made out of leather and paint, but it’s up high enough that no one can get a close look.
45	这家酒馆的一面大墙上绘有该地区的地图，鼓励顾客将小钉子钉在自己的家乡位置。 One of the large walls in this tavern has a painted map of the region covering it. Patrons are encouraged to place a small nail into their hometown.
46	这家酒馆以来自该地区各地的异域美酒为特色。酒馆老板是一位旅行者，常将从众多停留地带回的美酒运至酒馆，供顾客享用。玩家们可以找到各式各样的特色酒瓶，甚至可能发现来自自己家乡的那一款。 This tavern specializes in exotic wines from all around the region. The tavernkeeper is a traveler and will often ship wine from his many stops to the tavern for his patrons to enjoy. The players can find a wide variety of special wine bottles, maybe even one from the player's hometown.
47	酒馆后院设有射箭/投斧靶场，常被顾客用来解决赌约、争端或单纯找乐子。 The tavern has a archery/axe throwing range out back that is often used by customers to settle bets, disputes, or just have a good time.
48	这家酒馆的地面是由精美玻璃马赛克铺就，图案生动描绘了这座城市的起源故事。 The floor of this tavern is a beautifully crafted glass mosaic that explains in pictures how the city came to be.
49	酒馆每天早晨秘密藏起十枚硬币大小的木制徽章。找到一枚即可兑换一杯自选的低档饮品。酒馆装饰丰富，藏匿之处众多。 Tavern secretly hides 10 coin-sized wooden emblems across it every morning. If you find one, you can exchange it for a bottom-shelf drink of your choice. The tavern is decorated enough that there are many spots for these to be hidden in.
50	一位平庸的吟游诗人正对着一群无聊的观众表演，当玩家们走进酒馆时，诗人突然转唱一首调侃他们的歌曲，引得观众哄堂大笑。诗人继续加大嘲讽力度。 A mediocre bard is performing to a bored crowd when the players walk into this tavern. The bard all of a sudden switches to a song poking fun at the players walking in, and the crowd finds it hilarious. The bard doubles down on his roasts.
51	这家酒馆位于两座主要城市的中点，因此生意兴隆。常能见到名流显贵在此下榻。 This tavern is the halfway point between two major cities, which means that it receives a lot of business. It is not uncommon to see very popular and important people staying here.
52	这家酒馆的墙壁装饰着用骨头雕刻的雕花和作为战利品展示的鱼类标本。 This tavern's walls are decorated with scrimshaw, carved from bone, and fish that were mounted as trophies.
53	这家酒馆的公共区域用薄帘隔开，并摆放了许多舒适的坐垫供人懒散休息。地毯厚实且吸音。 This tavern's common area is partitioned with thin curtains and has many cushions for comfortable lounging. The carpets are thick and sound-absorbent.
54	吧台后方立着一尊真人大小的人形雕像，双手遮眼，据说是酒馆的原主人。传说他爱上了一位美杜莎，却不慎被她石化。多年来，许多施法者试图解除这一状态，却都未能成功。 A life sized statue behind the bar of a human man covering his eyes is supposedly the original owner of the tavern. Legend has it he fell in love with a Medusa and she accidentally turned him to stone. Many spellcasters over the years have tried to reverse the condition, yet failed.
55	这家酒馆由修道院改建而成，整个区域因圣地加持而笼罩在魔法般的寂静中。远近的顾客纷至沓来，只为享受这里非凡的宁静与安宁。不过点餐和饮品稍显麻烦，需通过比划进食或饮用的动作来示意，且只能享用当日供应的餐点。 The tavern is a renovated monastery. The grounds were hallowed such that the entire area is magically silent. Patrons come from near and far for the extraordinary peace and quiet it offers. Ordering food and drink can be a bit of a hassle though, having to pantomime eating or drinking, and being brought whatever is being served that day.
56	"为家庭友好而设计，欢乐地牢设有一座地牢主题的障碍赛道。付费后，游客可躲避“火焰”，与“骷髅”战斗，并被“食人魔”追逐。 Designed to be family-friendly, the Fungeon houses a dungeon-inspired obstacle course. For a fee, visitors can dodge ""flames"", battle ""skeletons', and get chased by an ""ogre""."
57	这家酒馆的公共区域中央有一座巨大的“篝火式”壁炉。顾客们会得到生肉，在明火上烤制作为餐食。 This tavern has an enormous 'bonfire-style' hearth in the middle of the common room. Patrons are given raw meat to roast over the open fire as a meal.
58	这家酒馆秘密供应鼠肉。由于无法获得廉价的蛋白质，店主从当地猎人那里弄来了几具巨型鼠尸。员工们正用蹩脚的借口维持着这个假象，对食物的风味感到不安。 This tavern is secretly serving rat meat. Unable to secure affordable proteins, the owner has procured several giant rat carcasses from a local hunter. The staff is uncomfortably maintaining the charade with lame excuses about the flavor of the food.
59	菜单（或酒保/女招待）坚持为菜单上的每样食物搭配一种香料腌肉。你想要麦酒？有肉配它。葡萄酒？有肉配它。你只想点些稀粥独自待着？太糟了！也有肉配它。 The menu (or barkeep/barmaid) insists on pairing everything on the menu with a spiced meat. You want ale? There's a meat for it. Wine? There's a meat for it. You just want to order some gruel and be left alone? Too bad! There's a meat for that.
60	这家酒馆是蜜酒与狂欢之神的圣殿，由一群热情洋溢的祭司经营，他们将免费提供酒精视为神圣职责。然而，他们认为饮酒者在未醉至疯狂前离开是极大的侮辱。 This tavern is a temple to a god of mead and revelry. The tavern is staffed by a sect of gregarious priests who consider it their holy duty to provide alcohol without charge. They do, however, consider it a grave insult for those who imbibe to leave before becoming wildly intoxicated.
61	酒馆内有一间独立的图书室，书籍大多沾满酒渍，但你的玩家或许能在书架上发现一些有趣且被遗忘的典籍。 There is a library in a separate room connected to this tavern. The books are mostly stained with alcohol, but your players might find some interesting, forgotten tomes among the shelves.
62	酒吧后面有一个铁笼子，里面关着一只鹦鹉。有些夜晚，店主会把它从笼子里拿出来，展示它会的把戏。 There is a parrot in an iron cage behind the bar. Some nights, the tavernkeeper takes it out of its cage and shows off the tricks it knows.
63	店主/酒保曾多年经商，对讨价还价情有独钟。吧台后的大黑板上列出了今晚顾客从他那里砍到的最低价，还附有当前头号吝啬鬼的粉笔肖像。 The owner/bartender was a merchant for many years and can't reset a good haggle. A large chalkboard behind the bar displays a list of the lowest prices customers have managed to get out of him this evening, complete with a chalk portrait of the current #1 cheapskate.
64	这家酒馆由一对从遥远国度旅居至此的夫妇建造。建筑风格、饮品和食物均源自他们的故乡，其习俗对玩家而言全然陌生。 This tavern was built by a couple who traveled here from a very far away land. The architecture, drinks, and food are all from their native country and the customs are completely foreign to the players.
65	这家酒馆建在一座古老堡垒的废墟之中。墙壁上仍保留着原堡垒被围攻时的损毁痕迹，但酒馆老板认为这种美学正是生意源源不断的原因。 This tavern is built within the ruins of an old fortress. The walls still have damage from when the original fortress was under siege, but the tavernkeeper thinks the aesthetic is what keeps business coming back.
66	这家酒馆自夸拥有本地区最辣的辣椒。如果你能吃完一碗而不晕倒，就可以在“火焰墙”上留下你的名字。 This tavern boasts that it has the hottest chili in the region. If you can finish a bowl without passing out, you can add your name to the Wall of Flame.
67	这家酒馆内部宽敞的公共区域被一个深达20英尺的巨大格斗坑所占据，众人皆称之为“斗坑”。 Inside, this tavern's spacious common room is dominated by a great fighting pit set 20 ft. deep within its floor, known to everyone as 'The Pit'.
68	酒馆装饰着历史上存在于各领域的强大武器复制品。玩家可以在此了解你战役中最强大的神器。 The tavern is adorned with replica versions of powerful weapons that existed in the realms history. The players can learn about some of the most powerful artifacts in your campaign here.
69	这家酒馆有一段楼梯通向建筑的地下部分。当你走下楼梯时，会进入一个酒馆建在其上的地下洞穴。洞穴经过装饰，甚至在角落设有一个吧台。支付费用后，你可以借用鱼竿在洞穴的池塘中钓取洞穴鱼。 This tavern has a staircase that leads to an underground section of the building. When you descend the stairs, you are brought into an underground cavern that the tavern was built over. The cavern is decorated and even has a bar in the corner. For a fee, you can borrow fishing rods and fish for cave fish in the cavern's pond.
70	这家酒馆接待神祇，同时存在于凡间与神界。尽管其真实本质被遮掩，许多顾客都是化为人形的神明。他们通过这些伪装考验凡人的价值，寻找合适的先知与勇士，并向赢得他们同情者赐福。该领域的许多半神都归功于这家酒馆的因缘。 This tavern hosts divine beings. This tavern exists both in the mortal and divine realms. Though their true nature is cloaked, many of the patrons are gods in human form. Within these guises they test mortals with trials of worthiness, search for suitable prophets and champions, and give blessings to those who earn their sympathy. Many of the realm's demi-gods owe their conception to the tavern.
71	所有顾客必须在此酒馆门口寄存武器，类似大衣寄存。你会得到一张编号票，武器则被存放在帘子后的后室。玩家们不知道的是，这家酒馆以“意外”用劣质仿品替换寄存的高品质或魔法武器而臭名昭著。 All patrons must check their weapons at the door of this tavern, much like a coat check. You are given a numbered ticket and the weapon is stored away in a back room behind a curtain. Unbeknownst to the players, this tavern is notorious for “accidentally” replacing high quality or magical weapons that have been checked with inferior duplicates.
72	这家酒馆雇佣了一位拥有烹饪天赋但脾气暴躁的食人魔。顾客们常常能听到他在厨房里咆哮和摔东西，同时享用他令人惊叹的菜肴。 This tavern has employed an ogre who has a culinary gift but a horrible temper. Patrons can often hear him screaming and throwing things around the kitchen while dining on his amazing dishes.
73	这家酒馆的所有家具都由石头制成。虽不舒适，但能在打斗时防止家具损坏。 All of the furniture in this tavern is made of stone. It's not very comfortable but it keeps the furniture from breaking when a fight breaks out.
74	这家酒馆正遭抢劫。店主被持刀挟持在另一房间。劫匪决定假扮侍者，等待队伍离开。 This tavern is being robbed. The owners are being held at knifepoint in another room. The robbers have decided that the best way through is to play the part of the wait staff and wait for the party to leave.
75	这家酒馆拥有复杂的滑轨和滑轮系统，使啤酒无需酒保离开吧台即可送至每张餐桌。 This tavern has an intricate slide and pulley system that allows beer to be delivered to every table without the tavernkeeper leaving the bar.
76	一把魔法弩悬挂在吧台上方。一些顾客相信它曾是店主冒险岁月中的武器，但店主对此既不承认也不否认。 A magical crossbow is mounted over the bar. Some patrons believe that it used to belong to the tavernkeeper back in his adventuring days, but the tavernkeeper never admits or denies anything.
77	这家酒馆藏有秘密地下区域，是当地盗贼公会的据点。敏锐的玩家可能会注意到某些顾客向酒馆老板做出隐秘手势，随后被引至单独的房间。 This tavern has a secret underground section that houses the local Thieves' Guild. Astute players may notice that certain patrons give the tavernkeeper a secret hand signal and then are escorted to a seperate room.
78	这间酒馆的公共区域周围摆放着几个燃烧的香炉，散发出浓烈而奇异的香气。这些香料均来自世界各地的遥远之地。 This tavern has several burning incense holders around the common room that give the inside a strong, exotic smell. The incense is all from far-off places in the world.
79	一个世纪前，经营这家酒馆的家族在一场火灾中全部丧生。随着时间的推移，他们的灵魂附身于活人宿主，迫使这些人重建家园并重现他们过去的生活。如今，酒馆生意兴隆。然而，员工们有时会无缘无故地哭泣，或是长时间茫然凝视。宿主们仍被困在自己的身体里，渴望逃脱。 A century ago, the family that ran this tavern all died in a fire. In time, their spirits came to possess living hosts, whom they have forced to rebuild their home and act out their former lives. Now the tavern is a successful business. However, the staff can sometimes be seen weeping for no reason, or staring blankly for minutes at a time. The hosts are still trapped within their bodies, desperate for escape.
80	这家酒馆的壁炉周围墙上绘有一幅世界地图。来访的旅人在各地附近的裂缝中留下便条，附带关于该地区的一些信息。 This tavern has a map of the world painted on the wall around the fireplace. Visiting travelers leave notes stuck in the cracks near various places with a bit of information about that area.
81	这家酒馆正被一位不谨慎的贵族光顾，他正在与人私会。贵族与情人正在楼上。在公共大厅里，坐着几位贵族的随从以及许多当地居民，他们都已收下金币保持沉默。空气中弥漫着一种夸张的若无其事。 This tavern is being visited by an indiscrete noble having an affair. The noble is upstairs with their lover. In the common room are several members of the noble’s staff as well as many local folks who have pocketed pouches of gold to stay silent. There is an air of exaggerated nonchalance.
82	这家酒馆深受精灵建筑风格启发，仅供应精灵美食。 This tavern is heavily inspired by elven architecture and only serves elven cuisine.
83	这家酒馆的公共休息室里住着一只友善的狗。不同的人会看到这只狗的不同形态。高地野蛮人眼中它是一只长毛红毛高地塞特犬，而木精灵可能看到的是黑色猎狼犬，山地矮人则可能视其为小型捕鼠梗犬。这种差异在当时不太可能被注意到，只有在离开酒馆后的交谈中才会被提及。 A friendly dog lives in the common room of this tavern. The unusual thing is that everyone sees the dog differently. A highlander Barbarian sees the dog as a longhaired red highland setter, but a wood elf might see the dog as a black wolfhound, and a mountain Dwarf might see it as a small rat-terrier. This difference is unlikely to be noticed at the time, and only comes up during conversation later, after leaving the tavern.
84	酒馆紧邻一座美丽但非常喧闹的瀑布而建。老板认为在瀑布旁建酒馆是明智之举，然而，距离前门仅几步之遥的瀑布轰鸣声几乎让人听不清里面的任何声音。 The tavern is built right next to a beautiful but very loud waterfall. The tavern owner thought it was a smart business move to build next to the waterfall, but you can barely hear anything inside over the roar of the waterfall only a short distance away from the front door.
85	这家酒馆的酒杯呈棱镜状且更加耐用。实际上这是酒馆的副业，你可以以每杯1金币的价格购买，打碎还会被罚款（除了棱镜效果外，它们可能还有其他特性，重点是它们很特别，可以作为不错的纪念品） The drinking glasses in this tavern are prismatic and more durable. It's actually a side-business the tavern has going for it, you can buy them for 1 gold per glass and will be charged for breaking them (could have qualities other than being prismatic, the point is that they're special and could make for a good souvenir)
86	这家酒馆的内墙上挂满了火把和枝形吊灯，点燃时散发出银白色的火焰。 This tavern's inner walls are covered with torches and chandeliers that glow with a silver-white flame when lit.
87	数十个鹅蛋大小的光球在酒馆内慵懒地漂浮，散发出充足的光亮——以避开阴暗角落和邪恶的密谋。 Dozens of floating orbs of light, the size of goose eggs, drift lazily around the tavern, giving off plenty of illumination - to avoid dark corners and sinister plotting.
88	此地长久以来是间谍会面、交易和交换信息的聚集地。当地人出入无阻，但像旅行冒险者这样的不寻常顾客则会受到隐秘而彻底的调查。 This location has long been a meeting place for spies to meet, make deals, and exchange information. Local folks come and go from the place without harassment, but unusual patrons, like traveling adventurers, are slyly and thoroughly investigated.
89	这家酒馆的所有饮料龙头都被设计成木蛇吐水的模样。 All of the beverage faucets in this tavern are fashioned to resemble a wooden snake spitting the liquid out.
90	酒馆角落里有一具用金属框架支撑的骷髅，穿着葬服，满身灰尘。若被问及，店主会声称那是他的祖父，多年前去世时要求在酒馆里“安葬”。据说离开时亲吻骷髅的脸颊会带来好运。 In the corner of the tavern is a skeleton held together with a wired frame. The skeleton is dressed in burial clothing and is covered in dust. If asked, the tavernkeeper will claim that the skeleton is his grandfather, and he requested to be 'buried' in the tavern when he died years and years ago. It's also good luck to kiss the skeleton on the cheek when you leave.
91	吧台后，店主在墙上挂着一系列精美的盘子。墙上挂着2d20个盘子，每个都有不同的设计。 Behind the bar, the tavernkeeper keeps a collection of fine plates hung upon the wall. There are 2d20 plates hung up, each with a different design.
92	这家酒馆与邻近的一家长期不和。这两家酒馆由古老的家族经营了数百年，而这两个家族之间的纷争也持续了几乎同样长的时间。很久以前，愤怒曾导致流血事件，但两家年轻继承人的婚约维持了和平。然而，这些年轻人打算在别处寻找真爱，这为外人平息或加剧冲突提供了机会。 This tavern is in a feud with a neighboring one. This tavern and the one next to it have been operated by the same ancient clans for hundreds of years, and the two clans have been embroiled in a feud for almost as long. Long ago, blood was spilt over their anger, but a betrothal between the families' young heirs has maintained the peace. These young people intend to find their own love elsewhere, opening the door for outsiders to somehow quell or exaggerate the conflict.
93	这家酒馆以其举办的赤足走火比赛而闻名。酒馆中央摆放着一块精心照看的炭火床。比赛的获胜者通常能获得当晚的免费饮品和餐食。 This tavern is known for the fire walking competition it hosts. A bed of coals rests in the center of the tavern and is carefully tended by its staff. Those who win the competition typically get free drinks and meals for the night.
94	这家酒馆里有1d100只不同的猫在避难。店主是个狂热的猫爱好者，收留了所有流浪猫。它们都吃得很好，得到了精心的照料。 There are 1d100 different cats taking refuge in this tavern. The innkeeper is an avid cat lover and takes in any and all strays. They are all very well fed and well taken care of.
95	在这家酒馆里，一张长长的骰子桌构成了整个吧台，你通过掷骰子来决定饮品的价格。 In this tavern, a long dice table makes up the entire bar and you roll to determine the price of your drink.
96	在这家酒馆里，所有的食物和饮品都由一只龟壳上固定着小木桌的乌龟送来。有时你的点单可能需要稍等片刻才能送达。 In this tavern, all food and drink are brought to you by a tortoise with a small wooden table on its shell. Sometimes it may take a little while for your order to get to you.
97	这家酒馆装饰着大量老旧且使用过的武器，以及来自不同阵营和战斗的破损盾牌。 This tavern is heavily decorated with old and well-used weaponry and split shields from a number of different factions and battles.
98	由矮人石匠大师打造的酒馆，每张桌凳均为整块石雕，通过隐藏在地板中的巧妙凹槽，能如玻璃般滑行于地面。只需几分钟，便可将所有桌子排列成一条曲折的长宴桌。 A tavern made by a master dwarven stonemason, each table and stool is a full piece of stonework, which slides glassily across the floor on clever grooves hidden in the floor. Given a few minutes, you can arrange every table in the place into one long feast table, with the tables making a sort of zig-zag line.
99	"所有食物和饮品都带有一丝异样的味道，虽不至于难以下咽，但足以让人察觉到不对劲。当被问及时，酒保只是微笑着表示这里的一切都添加了“特殊调料”。调查后将揭示，店主养了蜗牛，并将它们的粘液作为所有食物的主要成分。他还会用自己最喜爱的蜗牛的粘液来招待常客。 All the food and drink have a slightly off taste. Not to the point of inedibility, but enough to notice something's off about it. When asked, the bartender just smiles and says everything's spiced with a ""special ingredient"" here. An investigation will reveal the barkeep raises snails and uses their slime as a staple ingredient in all of the food. He uses the slime from his favorite snails for his regulars."
100	这家酒馆每周每晚都有“开放麦之夜”。玩家可能会发现自己与世界闻名的吟游诗人、平庸的诗人或巡回杂技表演者等为伴。每次都是完全随机的。 This tavern has an 'open-mic night' every night of the week. The players might find that they are in the company of a world-famous bard, a mediocre poet, a traveling acrobatic act, etc. It's always completely random.
