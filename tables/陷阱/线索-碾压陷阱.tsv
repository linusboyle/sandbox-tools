1d10	线索-碾压陷阱
1	从天花板到地面的狭窄凹槽似乎被精心打磨过 Narrow notches from ceiling to floor seem painstakingly smoothed
2	天花板上有一道泛着光泽的暗红色污渍 There's a discoloring scarlet smear glistening on the ceiling here
3	误以为是地板上的污渍，实为一只被压扁的老鼠，四肢向四面八方摊开 Mistook for a stain on the floor, a flattened Rat, legs splayed in all directions
4	前方碎石片和粗糙鹅卵石形成一条细长的直线堆 A scree of stone shards and rough pebbles form a thin, straight mound ahead
5	突兀地凸出，此处宽度不均令人费解 Abruptly jutting out, why the width isn't as even here is puzzling
6	平行的沟槽横穿前方路径，表面覆盖着某种类似油脂的粘滑物质 Parallel furrows bisect path ahead, slimy with what seems to be some kind of grease
7	一根原本非常坚固的长矛的柄，被猛烈地折断成两半 The haft of what must of have been a very Sturdy Spear, violently broken in half
8	弯曲/生锈凹陷，三节原本应是巨大链条的链环躺在此处 Bent /pitted with Rust, three links of what must have been a massive chain rest here
9	头顶，石头的质地似乎发生了变化：粗糙的石块被点缀以融入环境 Overhead, character of the stone seems to change: rougher Stones spackled to blend in
10	这里的壁龛/凹痕似乎与对应的凸起部分对齐 Alcoves/indentions here seem to line up with corresponding protrusions
