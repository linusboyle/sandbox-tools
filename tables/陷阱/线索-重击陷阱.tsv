1d10	线索-重击陷阱
1	被碾成火柴棍，几乎可以肯定那曾经是某种凳子或椅子 Pulverized to matchsticks, pretty sure that used to be a stool or chair of some kind
2	"一股不合时宜的“松木”气味，树脂痕迹和粗糙的树皮结痂 An out of place ""piney"" smell, traces of resin and rough scabs of bark"
3	天花板开始急剧向上倾斜，逐渐脱离你的火把照明范围 Ceiling begins sloping up rather dramatically, taking itself out of your torchlight
4	灰浆中嵌入了毛发和骨头的碎片，痕迹久远 Bits and traces of hair and bone, embedded in the mortar, long after it set
5	深圆形壁龛上油光闪闪，困住了各种小昆虫 Deep circular niche glistens with grease and has ensnared all kinds of small insects
6	一侧严重凹陷，一顶废弃的头盔如今成了蛛网的家 One side savagely dented, a cast-off Helm is now home to cobwebs
7	沉闷的刮擦声伴随着响亮的咔嗒声，刚开始就突然停止 Dull scraping sound punctuated by clangorous clicks, stops as soon as it starts
8	反复的锤击似乎在这里的石头上磨出了一个凹痕 Repeated Pummeling appears to have worn a depression in the stone here
9	破碎的陶片，部分碾成粉末，随意地扫在一旁 Broken clay shards, some crushed to powder, swept unceremoniously aside here
10	形状和大小约如人头，几块带血的巨石出奇地轻松滚动 Shaped and hewn to about head-size, a few bloody Boulders roll with surprising ease
