1d10	线索-毒气陷阱
1	火炬火焰突然闪烁，呈现苍白无力，随后猛烈燃烧 Torchflame suddenly sputters, taking on anemic pallor then vigorously burning
2	空气中弥漫着涩味和药味：仿佛烈酒变酸般刺鼻 Astringent, medicinal smell in the air: Almost like strong Spirits gone sour
3	此处脚踝高的低薄雾气懒散地聚集，气味难以辨认 A low haze seems to lethargically pool ankle-high here, can't quite place the smell
4	碎布片，可能是手帕，全都沾满干涸的红色污渍 Scraps of cloth, maybe handkerchiefs, all caked with crusty red stains
5	某些表面轻微覆盖着一种病态的浅绿色，类似盐的物质 Some surfaces are lightly encrusted with a sickly chartreuse, salt-like substance
6	微弱但持续的嘶嘶声，音量虽小却奇怪地均匀一致 Muffled but steady hiss, very slight but strangely even in modulation and volume
7	眼睛流泪，你能看到同伴的眼白明显变红 Eyes water, you can see the sclera of your companions start to redden significantly
8	墙内是否有死物？腐烂的气味，犹如玫瑰在花瓶中放置过久 Is something dead within walls here? Smell of rot, like Roses left too long in a vase
9	碎玻璃片似乎被扫到角落，整齐地堆成小堆 Shards of shattered glass seem to be swept into neat piles near corners
10	近二十具蜥蜴/老鼠尸体，以不自然的姿势扭曲，惨不忍睹 Almost a score of Lizard/Mice corpses, gruesomely contorted in unnatural positions
