1d10	线索-劈砍陷阱
1	股骨，被非常平滑且平整的断裂劈开，早已被害虫掏空了骨髓 Femur, split by a very smooth and flat break, long since robbed of marrow by vermin
2	一层极薄的烟灰覆盖在地板上刻出的狭窄凹槽边缘 A very thin layer of soot lines a narrow notch graven through the floor here
3	墙上的覆盖物因那些巨大的虫洞而显得破旧不堪 Wall covering has seen better days given those very large moth holes
4	三块磨刀石被丢弃于此，因使用频繁而磨得光滑发亮 A trio of Whetstones, polished and worn smooth from use was discarded here
5	此处表面留有深且剧烈的划痕，高度至精灵颈部 Deep and violently scored gouge mars surfaces here, neck high to an Elf
6	匆忙冲洗后，看似血迹的痕迹仅被推到已干涸的水池边缘 Hastily rinsed, what look like bloodstains merely driven to the edges of now dry pools
7	此处最近重新涂抹了灰泥，颜色比旧层略深 Plaster has been re-applied here recently, it's slightly darker than the older layer
8	与平常环境格格不入，低沉的嗡鸣和紧绷物体的断裂声 Standing out from usual ambience, a low murmur and snap of something straining
9	严重刻痕且几乎锈穿，一把长柄战斧的残刃 Heavily nicked and nearly rusted through, the remains of a Poleaxe blade
10	一面氧化且缺齿的齿轮，大小如小圆盾，泰然自若地倚靠在墙边 An oxidized and gap-toothed gear, size of a buckler, rests sanguinely against a wall
