1d10	线索-陷坑陷阱
1	树叶掩盖不专业，木屑痕迹在石头上格外显眼 inexpertly concealed by leaves, traces of wood stand out from stone
2	微弱的水流声，水向最低处流动，在边缘略微积聚 faint, trickling sounds, as water runs to the lowest point, pooling slightly at the edge
3	尘土上的脚印在石板附近突然中断，几英尺后又继续出现 dusty footprints stop abruptly near the flagstone, continue in a few feet
4	这条走廊的蜘蛛网异常密集，唯有一处方便通过的缺口。 spiderwebs are thick in this corridor, save for a convenient gap to pass through
5	墙壁上约脚踝高度处曾钉入岩钉的孔洞 holes where pitons were once driven in the walls at about ankle high
6	墙上挂着的大型弯曲生锈铁钩（用于拉合陷阱） large Bent and Rusty Iron Hook, hangs on the wall nearby (used to pull the trap closed)
7	此处轻微下陷导致大部分碎石和砂砾聚集在此区域 slight sag here has caused most of the gravel and grit to aggregate in this area
8	火炬壁龛大致均匀分布，但此处有一个更宽的间隙 torch Sconces are evenly spaced, for the most part, there's a wider gap here
9	破旧不堪，即使最轻微的风也能扰动覆盖的彩绘帆布 motheaten and worn, even the slightest breeze can disturb the painted canvas covering
10	此处霉味和咸水气息刺激鼻腔，矮个子感觉更强烈 smell of mold and brackish water tickle nostrils here, stronger for the shorter folks
