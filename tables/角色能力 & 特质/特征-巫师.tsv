"1d200"	"特征-巫师"
1	"成千上万只小鸟的翅膀被缝在巫师全身。衣物上的缝隙让翅膀得以伸出，使巫师能以小鸟的速度和精准度飞行。 Thousands of tiny bird wings have been sewn all over the wizard’s body. Slits in their clothing allow the wings to poke out, and enable wizard to fly with the speed and precision of a small bird."
2	"巫师的双腿在膝盖以下被截肢，并与两只灰狗的后背融合。他们将狗作为自身的延伸进行控制，能够以八条狗腿极速移动。此外，必要时他们还能进行两次撕咬攻击。 The wizard’s legs have been amputated beneath the knee, and fused to the backs of two Greyhound dogs. They control the dogs as extensions of themselves, and are able to move incredibly quickly on their eight dog legs. Also, if need be, they have two bite attacks."
3	"巨蝎的尾巴和毒刺被连接到巫师的脊椎上，使其每回合都能发动致命的毒液攻击。 The tail and stinger of a giant scorpion have been attached to the wizard’s spine, giving them a deadly poison attack each round."
4	"快速一展，法师的双臂瞬间化为钩爪怪般的钩子。他们每轮获得两次凶猛的近战攻击，攀爬速度减半，且擒抱时视为拥有比实际多两枚生命骰的能力。 A quick flex causes the wizard’s arms to pop into the form of a Hook Horror’s hooks. They gain two nasty melee attacks each round, the ability to climb at half their normal movement speed, and to grapple as if they had two more hit dice than they do."
5	"在采集并摄入了移位兽的位移腺体后，这位法师在空间中总是显得比实际位置偏离约3英尺。这使得他们几乎无法被击中，直到这种差异被察觉。即便如此，这种效果也令人迷惑，并大幅提升了他们的有效护甲等级。 After harvesting and ingesting the displacement glands from a Displacer Beast, the wizard now always appears to be about 3’ away from their actual position in space. This makes them nearly impossible to hit until the discrepancy is noticed. Even then, the effect is disorienting and grants them a significant bonus to their effective armor rating."
6	"这位巫师奴役了另一位巫师的幽灵。被奴役的巫师拥有另一套法术，实质上使得“主人”巫师每轮能施放两个法术。被束缚的巫师对其处境极为不满，会欣然利用任何对其魔法束缚的干扰。 The wizard has enslaved the ghost of another wizard. This second wizard has a second repertoire of spells. Essentially, this allows the ‘master’ wizard to cast two spells each round. The enthralled wizard is not happy about their situation, and will gladly take advantage of any disruption to their magical bonds."
7	"通过习惯性地吞噬其他施法者的大脑，这位巫师极大地增强了所掌握的每一个法术。他们施放的法术比其他施法者更为强大。例如，若施放魔法飞弹，每发飞弹将造成d8而非d4的伤害；若知晓睡眠术，其影响的目标生命骰数可达基础法术的两倍，以此类推。 By making a habit of consuming the brains of other magic users, this wizard has made powerful improvements to every spell they know. Any spell they cast is more effective than it would be in the hands of other casters. As an example, if they were to cast Magic Missile, each one would deal d8 damage rather than d4. If they know Sleep, it can target twice as many hit dice worth of creatures as the base spell, and so on, and so forth."
8	"一次精心设计的传送失误使这位法师与恶魔融合。得益于周密的准备，他们得以掌控这具共享的新躯体。这赋予了他们随时召唤地狱恶魔助阵的能力。恶魔们视法师为同类，但真相或许终将揭晓。 A cleverly engineered Teleport error caused this wizard to become fused to a demon. Thanks to careful preparations they were able to gain control over the new, shared body. This has given them the ability to summon other demons from hell to aide them whenever they need. The demons perceive the wizard as one of their own, but could potentially be shown the truth."
9	"通过跨维度粘合剂，这位巫师将恶魔的思维附着于己身。此举赋予了他们完备的法律知识，以及用灵魂交换愿望的能力。若不仔细阅读契约，你可能会发现自己的灵魂已归巫师所有，同时愿望也转移给了他们！ By means of extra dimensional adhesive, this wizard has affixed the mind of a devil to themselves. This has granted them perfect legal knowledge, and the ability to trade souls for wishes. If you don’t read your contract carefully, you’ll find yourself giving the wizard your soul, and in the same line transferring your wish to them!"
10	"善良生物的问题在于愚蠢者得以幸存。这位法师如何戏弄天使与之融合有个有趣的故事，但此举赋予了他们施展治疗魔法、以惊人速度飞行以及用令人畏惧敬畏的声音说话的能力，听到者需进行豁免检定以免因恐惧而畏缩。 The problem with good creatures is that the foolish ones are allowed to survive. There’s a funny story behind how this wizard tricked an angel into fusing with them, but it has given them the ability to perform healing magics, fly at tremendous speeds, and speak in a voice which requires a saving throw versus cowering in terrified awe."
11	"通过与好奇的元素生物交易部分灵魂，这位法师获得了与特定元素的强烈联系：火、冰、风、水、土、酸、重力、自然或其他！与他们所联系的元素相关的任何伤害反而会治愈他们。 By offering to trade part of their soul with a curious elemental, this wizard has gained a strong alignment with a particular element: Fire, Ice, Wind, Water, Earth, Acid, Gravity, Nature, or other! Any damage which might be caused by whatever they’re aligned with instead heals them."
12	"多年来每晚将双眼取出浸泡于神明痛苦的蒸馏液中，使这位巫师获得了凝视攻击。目标必须进行豁免检定，否则受到2d6点伤害。 Years taking their eyes out each night to soak in a distillation of god’s pain has given this wizard a gaze attack. Targets must make a saving throw or take 2d6 damage."
13	"定期注射蛇怪眼泪使这位法师能够始终使一个目标保持麻痹状态。对此无法进行豁免检定。法师每回合开始时可以自由选择要麻痹的目标。 Regular injections of basilisk tears grant this wizard the ability to keep one target paralyzed at all times. There is no saving throw against this. The wizard may change who they wish to paralyze at the start of each round as a free action."
14	"饮用古老沼泽之水赋予这位巫师凝视攻击能力，可使目标缩小至当前体型的50%。他们可对同一目标多次施放，每次均使其体型减半。 Drinking from an ancient bog has given this wizard a gaze attack which causes anyone they target to shrink to 50% of their current size. They can target the same person as many times as they want, reducing them by 50% each time."
15	"在年少轻狂时，这位巫师习得了偷袭伤害的能力。此能力适用于他们的法术，且他们很可能特意创造了一些隐秘的法术变体以充分利用这一优势。 During a misspent youth, this wizard gained the ability to deal sneak attack damage. It applies to their spells, and they’ve likely made a point of creating some sneaky spell variants to best take advantage of this."
16	"这位巫师在投身法术之前曾在军团服役多年，拥有魔法使用者中罕见的武艺，其攻击能力等同于同等级战士。 This wizard served in the legions for years before turning to spellcraft. They have a martial prowess unusual to magic users. They attack as a fighter of their level."
17	"这位法师出生于边疆居民家庭，在荒野中如同在图书馆或象牙塔中一样自在。他们懂得如何觅食、制作工具和搭建庇护所、狩猎、追踪，并在恶劣环境中生存。 Born to frontierspeople, this wizard is as at home in the wilderness as they are in a library or ivory tower. They know how to forage, build tools and shelters, hunt, track, and survive in harsh circumstances."
18	"通过将眼魔的自我意识困在罐中（存放在家中保险库），他们将其转化为忠诚的仆从。它随行各处，完全效忠。 By trapping a Beholder’s ego in a jar (which is kept in a vault back home), they’ve turned it into a loyal servitor. It goes everywhere with them, and is completely loyal."
19	"曾被一位破碎之神注视过的这位法师能够分身两地。他们可以同时存在于两个地方，每个分身都是完全真实且具备完整能力的。他们必须合二为一才能入睡。如果其中一个入睡，另一个无论身在何处都会消失并与睡着的分身合并。 Having once been observed by a broken god, this wizard is able to bilocate. They can exist in two places at once, with each instance being fully real and fully capable. They must merge back together in order to sleep. If one of them falls asleep, the other vanishes to merge back with the sleeper no matter where they are."
20	"一场可怕的实验失败使这位巫师几乎失去了实体。他们仍然活着，甚至能通过施展巫师意志用手操控物体，但大多数触碰都会直接穿过他们。 An experiment gone terribly wrong has left this wizard mostly incorporeal. They’re still alive, and can even manipulate objects with their hands by flexing their wizardly will, but most touches pass right through them."
21	"这位巫师是全世界最棒的舞者，无人能及，无人能敌。 This wizard is the absolute best dancer in all the world. No one can out-dance them. No one."
22	"懂得在正确时机出现在正确地点，使这位法师积累了丰富的政治人脉。如果有人不欠他人情，那他们可能欠了欠法师人情的人的人情。 Knowing when to be in the right place at the right time has enabled this wizard to collect a wealth of political contacts. If there’s anyone who doesn’t owe them a favor, then they probably owe a favor to someone who owes the wizard a favor."
23	"这位巫师曾与一位德鲁伊维持了多年的浪漫关系。虽然几年前这段关系已经结束，但巫师仍保留着为了取悦伴侣而熟记的关于自然动植物的百科全书般知识。 For many years this wizard was involved in a romantic relationship with a druid. That ended a few years ago, but the wizard still has the friggin’ encyclopedic knowledge of natural flora and fauna they memorized in order to impress their partner."
24	"植物与这位法师有着特殊的关系，一种情欲的关系。整个植物王国都渴望与这位法师交合，并会做任何法师认为愉悦的事。树木会倒在法师的敌人身上，藤蔓会缠绕他们。植物性毒药对法师无效。 Plants share a special relationship with this wizard. An erotic one. All of kingdom vegetabilis wants to fuck this wizard, and will do anything the wizard says will be pleasing. Trees will fall on the wizard’s foes, or vines will entangle them. Plant based poisons will not affect the wizard."
25	"这位法师刻意忽视口腔卫生，使其口气蕴含力量。任何闻到的人都会产生最恐惧的幻觉。 A calculated disdain for oral hygiene has imbued this wizard’s breath with power. Anyone who smells it experiences a hallucination of their worst fears."
26	"频繁使用变形法术使这位法师能够随意与石头或沙子融合。尽管他们仍可化为人形，但实际上他们的身体是由一种智能的泥浆粘土构成。 Frequent abuse of form changing spells has allowed this wizard to merge themselves with stone or sand at will. Though they may still shape themselves into their human form, in actuality their body is composed of an intelligent muddy clay."
27	"此人不仅是强大的法师，还是一位拥有封地的贵族，享有该社会地位赋予的一切权利与特权。 In addition to being a powerful wizard, this person is also a landed noble with all the rights and privileges granted by that social station."
28	"在魔法意识较弱的族群中旅行时，巫师施展了许多法术，使许多人相信他们是神的化身。这些人以宗教般的狂热服从巫师的每一个意愿。 On their travels among less magically aware peoples, the wizard has performed many spells, and convinces a lot of people that they are an avatar of God. These people obey the wizard’s every whim with religious fervor."
29	"当这位巫师的手指断裂时，它们会变成小精灵生物，模样酷似《非常小特务》中的拇指怪。手指最终会重新长出来，但这对巫师来说显然相当痛苦。 When broken off, this wizard’s fingers will form into little gremlin creatures that look just like the thumbs from Spy Kids. The fingers grow back eventually, but it’s obviously quite painful for the wizard to do this."
30	"每当法师愿意时，一只凶猛的家猫会从其长袍口袋中跃出。这完全是一只普通的家猫，除了脾气极其暴躁外没有任何特殊能力。法师每天能以这种方式召唤出20只猫。这些猫永远不会消失，必须被喂养和照料，或以某种方式刻意处理掉。这些猫对法师也只是稍微友好一些。 Whenever the wizard wishes, a ferocious house cat will leap out of the pocket of their robe. This is in all ways a real house cat, with no special abilities aside from being incredibly ill-tempered. The wizard is able to produces 20 cats in this manner each day. The cats never disappear, and must either be fed and cared for, or gotten rid of in some deliberate manner. The cats are only slightly friendlier towards the wizard."
31	"这位巫师能随意分裂成四只喷火的地精。他们可能会声称自己一直是四只地精披着长袍，但这只是地精的谎言。只要有一只地精幸存，他们就能重新合体成巫师，但剩下的地精越少，合体所需的时间就越长。四只地精可以瞬间完成，而单独一只则需要数周时间。 At will this wizard can tumble apart into four fire breathing goblins. They may claim that they were always four goblins in a robe, but this is just a goblin lie. If even one goblin survives they can re-form into the wizard, but the fewer goblins remain the longer it takes to reform. All four goblins could do it instantaneously, while a solitary goblin will require several weeks."
32	"巫师对时间的感知速度是常人的两倍。对他们而言，世界仿佛在缓慢移动。因此，他们每轮能采取两次行动，护甲等级提升4点，并觉得大多数对话极其乏味。 The wizard’s experience of time is double normal speed. To them, the world appears to be moving very slowly. Because of this they’re able to take 2 actions each round, receive a +4 to their armor rating, and find most conversations painfully dull."
33	"这位巫师正在倒着生活。每天他们醒来时都是在前一天之前的日子。他们与人打招呼时说“再见”，告别时说“你好”。他们不记得与队伍可能有的任何过去相遇，但他们记得未来的相遇。 This wizard is living their life in reverse. Each day they wake up on the day before the last day they lived. When they greet someone they say “goodbye,” and when they depart they say “hello.” They don’t remember any past encounters they may have had with the party, but they do remember the future ones."
34	"这位法师只需指向地面某处，便能在那里制造出一个十五英尺深的坑洞。 By pointing at a spot on the ground this wizard is able to make a fifteen foot deep pit appear there."
35	"通过做出侮辱性手势，这位巫师能让石质尖刺从地面射出三英尺高，这些尖刺非常锋利。 By performing a bras d’honneur, this wizard is able to cause clusters of spikes to shoot three feet up from the ground. They’re made of stone, and quite sharp."
36	"通过拍手，这位法师能够使任意两面墙壁（或类似墙壁的自然构造）以极快的速度和力量猛烈相撞。墙壁的最远点必须相距不超过二十英尺。大多数情况下，这一行为会造成严重的结构损坏。 By clapping their hands, this wizard is able to cause any two walls (or wall-like natural formations) to slam together with great speed and force. The furthest points on the walls must be less than twenty feet apart. Most of the time this action will cause significant structural damage."
37	"此巫师30英尺内任何刚死亡的生物会自动作为亡灵仆从复活，受巫师意志支配。这包括普通动物、人类和怪物。 Any recently dead creature within 30 feet of this wizard automatically rises as an undead servitor under the wizard’s will. This includes common animals, people, and monsters."
38	"很久以前，这位巫师创造了十个永久的隐形仆从。它们始终伴随巫师左右，取工具、送信、记录口述、将爆炸物带入敌阵等等。若被摧毁，它们将在下次满月时重新形成。 Long ago this wizard created ten permanent unseen servants. They’re with the wizard at all times, fetching tools, delivering messages, taking dictation, carrying explosives into the midst of the wizard’s enemies, and so on. If any are destroyed, they will reform under the next full moon."
39	"这位巫师的胸部和手臂上长满了巨大的脓包，瘙痒难耐且令人不适，但若被刺破，会爆出一团毒气，而巫师对此免疫。 Great sloshing boils grow on this wizard’s chest and arms. They’re itchy and unpleasant, but if punctured they burst into a cloud of poison gas to which the wizard is immune."
40	"这位巫师没有眼睛、嘴巴、鼻子、耳朵或头发。他们的手指融合在一起，皮肤湿润，蓝色血管透过皮肤显现。这些特征丝毫不妨碍他们，并赋予他们对任何需看、闻、听或呼吸的伤害免疫。 This wizard has no eyes, mouth, nose, ears, or hair. Their fingers are fused together, their skin is wet, and blue veins show through it. None of these features hinder them in any way, and grants them immunity to any harms which must be seen, smelt, heard, or breathed."
41	"这位法师的肉质和骨骼富有弹性，使其坠落时能弹起而不受伤害。钝器也无法造成伤害，反而可能从攻击者手中弹开。只有劈砍武器在掷出较高数值时才能造成伤害。 Rubbery meat and bones allow this wizard to bounce when they fall, taking no damage. Bludgeoning instruments also deal no damage, and will likely bounce out of the attacker’s hands. Slashing weapons only deal damage if they roll in the upper half of their range."
42	"每晚将双手浸泡在由食尸鬼蒸馏而成的药水中，使巫师获得了通过触碰吸取他人等级的能力。 By soaking their hands each night in a lotion distilled from ghouls, the wizard has gained the ability to level drain anyone they touch."
43	"通过用偷来的吸血鬼獠牙替换自己的犬齿，这位巫师获得了咬击能力，并能通过吸血恢复生命值。 By replacing their own canines with stolen vampire fangs, this wizard has gained a bite attack, and the ability to drain blood to restore their health."
44	"禁忌的第四墙知识使这位巫师能够从游戏世界外伸手，每回合将一颗掷出的骰子转为对他们更有利的结果。 Forbidden knowledge of the fourth wall allows this wizard to reach out of the game world to turn one rolled die to a result that is more beneficial to them each round."
45	"“黑入”神明思维的能力使这位法师能暂时抹去一名玩家角色表上的某一行内容。 “Hacked” access to the mind of God allows this wizard to temporarily cancel out a single line from one player’s character sheet."
46	"从裁判心中NPC的应有位置扩散开来，这位法师无法控制裁判的声音，反而会鼓励玩家们反抗。他们中肯定有人比这个懦夫更适合当裁判！ Spreading out from the proper place of NPCs in the referee’s mind this wizard cant take control of the referee’s voice, and will encourage the players to revolt. Surely one of them would make a better referee than this weakling!?"
47	"这位法师长袍下几乎完全是机械构成，仅剩心脏、双手、头部等少数有机部分。他们可能依靠隐藏在袍边下的坦克履带移动。由于其独特的金属构造，他们无法被暴击或偷袭。 Beneath their robe this wizard is almost entirely mechanical. Only a few organic parts remain: their heart, hands, head, etc. They probably move on tank treads hidden by the hem of their robe. They cannot be critically hit or sneak attacked due to their unusual metal anatomy."
48	"这位巫师拥有三重冗余的解剖结构。三颗心脏、六个肺、三个胃等等。他们的生命值也因此翻了三倍。 This wizard has triple redundant anatomy. Three hearts, six lungs, three stomachs, and so on. Their hit points are likewise tripled."
49	"这位巫师在必要时能像海胆一样竖起尖刺，巨大的金属尖刺从毛孔中滑出。不过，当他们穿着最爱的舒适长袍时，可能就不太愿意这么做了。 This wizard is able to prickle up like a sea urchin if they need to. Big ol’ metal spikes sliding out of their pores. They’ll probably be less willing to do it when they’re wearing their favorite cozy robes, though."
50	"通过坚持一套不寻常的性行为准则，这位巫师解锁了随意变身为任何动物的能力。 By holding to a strict code of unusual sexual practices, this wizard has unlocked the ability to transform themselves into any animal at will."
51	"任何攻击此法师的武器都会转变为无害物品。本应刺穿其身体的剑可能变成一截绳子、一朵花或一个枕头。此效果同样适用于拳头，因此若不想让手变成泰迪熊，建议不要挥拳相向。 Any weapon which strikes this wizard transforms itself into a harmless object. A sword that would pierce their body might poof into a length of rope, a flower, or a pillow. This works for fists as well, so if you don’t want your hand replaced with a teddy bear, it would not be advisable to punch them."
52	"这位法师通过严格的声乐练习，能够完美模仿任何听到的声音。 Strenuous vocal exercise allows this wizard to perfectly emulate any voice they hear."
53	"极其费力的嗓音训练使这位巫师能以震耳欲聋的声音发言，构成音波攻击。在适当条件下，他们能轻易引发雪崩或岩崩，震碎玻璃或水晶物品等。 Incredibly strenuous vocal exercise allows this wizard to speak in a voice so booming it constitutes a sonic attack. They can easily start an avalanche or rock slide where conditions are appropriate, break glass or crystal objects, etc."
54	"这位法师培养出了一种如此强烈的威严气场，任何接近其五英尺范围内的人必须进行豁免检定，否则将被转化为顺从的小妖精。在此状态下，他们将服从法师的所有命令，持续一周，之后恢复原形。 This wizard has cultivated a commanding presence so intense that anyone who approaches within five feet of them must make a saving throw or be transformed into a servile gremlin. In this state they will obey all the wizard’s commands for 1 week, then transform back into themselves."
55	"该法师造成的任何伤害都带有次级变形效果。任何被法师的法杖、火球、拳头等击中的目标，必须进行豁免检定，否则将被变成某种无害的小动物。 Any damage dealt by this wizard has a secondary polymorph effect. Anyone struck by the wizard’s staff, fireball, fist, etc, must make a saving throw or be transformed into some harmless critter."
56	"这位巫师周身环绕着一团密集的荆棘球。每当巫师被触碰或近战武器击中时，攻击者都会受到少量伤害。 A thick swarm of thorny bulbs orbits this wizard’s body. Any time the wizard is touched, or struck with a melee weapon, their attacker takes a small amount of damage."
57	"这位法师每天可化身为树一次，此状态下无法移动，持续一小时后恢复原形，体力与法术完全恢复，此举已完全替代了睡眠。 Once per day this wizard can transform themselves into a tree. In this state they cannot move for one hour, after which they return to their natural shape fully rested with all their hit points and spells restored. It has completely replaced sleep for them."
58	"通过以特定的10次眨眼模式眨眼，这位巫师能够传送回他们上次睡觉的地方。该能力每小时仅能使用一次。 By blinking their eyes in a very particular 10-blink pattern, this wizard is able to teleport back to the last place they slept. The ability functions only once per hour."
59	"快速拉扯他们的胡须会形成一个保护泡包围这位法师。当保护泡存在时，他们无法移动、攻击或施放复杂法术，但可以说话或进行其他简单动作。 A quick tug of their beard causes a bubble of protection to surround this wizard. While the bubble is in place they cannot move, attack, or cast complex spells. They can speak or perform other simple actions."
60	"通过汲取自身少许生命力（d4生命值），这位法师能够创造一种临时的命匣。若他们在接下来的2小时内死亡，其灵魂将仍被束缚于尸体中。他们可以等待任意时长，然后重返躯体复活，并恢复一半的最大生命值。 By siphoning off a little of their own vitality (d4 hit points), this wizard is able to create a sort of temporary phylactery. If they die within the next 2 hours, their spirit will remain bound to their corpse. They can wait as long as they wish, then pop back into their bodies and return to life with half their maximum health restored."
61	"这位巫师被水晶包裹，身体无法移动，但水晶能随其意愿漂浮。他们想说的话会以文字形式在水晶表面滚动显示。水晶保护他们免受大多数攻击形式的伤害。 This wizard is encased in crystal. Their body is immobile, but the crystal floats around wherever they want it to go. Anything they want to say appears as text scrolling across the crystal’s surface. The crystal protects them from most forms of attack."
62	"除了魔法天赋，这位巫师还遭受了狼人诅咒。在月光下，他们会变身为狼人，或类似的生物，如熊人或鼠人。 In addition to their magical talents, this wizard has been afflicted with lycanthropy. Under moonlight they become a werewolf, or some similar creature like a werebear or wererat."
63	"这位巫师的一位祖先竟是只鼹鼠，这使他们能迅速在地面下挖掘，以大约一半的正常移动速度穿行于土中。 Somehow, one of this wizard’s ancestors was a mole. This allows them to burrow through the ground rapidly, digging tunnels through the earth at roughly half their normal movement speed."
64	"这位法师通过手术将大脑一分为二，以便同时更好地处理两个问题。对抗精神效果的豁免检定需进行两次，法师取较好结果。 This wizard has surgically split their brain in half so they can better work on two problems at once. Any saving throw against mental effects is made twice, and the wizard takes the better result."
65	"在此巫师30英尺范围内，除非是他们自己施放的魔法，否则魔法无法生效。 Within 30’ of this wizard, magic does not function unless it is magic they themselves have cast."
66	"一个奇特的手势使这位法师能够召唤并投掷一种幽灵般的套索。若角色被其捕获，将自动被迅速拉向法师，最终停在其身旁。 A peculiar hand gesture allows this wizard to conjure and throw a sort of spectral lasso. If a character is caught by it, they’re automatically yanked rapidly towards the wizard, coming to a stop right beside them."
67	"这位法师简直就是达斯·维达。要模糊处理，不让玩家立刻察觉，但他们穿着厚重的黑色盔甲，手持魔法剑，能随意施展心灵遥感，很可能与某位玩家角色有血缘关系。 This Wizard is just straight up Darth Vader. Obscure it so the players don’t realize it right away, but they wear heavy black armor, they carry a magic sword, they’re able to perform feats of telekinesis at will, they probably have a familial relationship with one of the PCs."
68	"这位法师体内有光芒闪耀，使他们的皮肤微微发光，并从身体的任何开口处射出耀眼的光辉。在黑暗中他们非常显眼，但拥有多种方法能瞬间致盲敌人。 A light shines within this wizard. It makes their skin glow faintly, and shines brilliantly from any opening into their body. They’re very visible in the dark, but have many ways of suddenly blinding their foes."
69	"这位巫师用活巨魔的骨髓替换了自己的骨髓，从而能够迅速自愈。每回合恢复d4点生命值，甚至断肢和断头最终也能再生。唯一能对巫师造成永久伤害的方法是用火。 Replacing their bone marrow with some taken from living trolls enables this wizard to heal rapidly. Each round they regain d4 hit points, and even severed limbs and heads will eventually regrow. The only way to deal permanent damage to the wizard is with fire."
70	"这位法师的下半身已被八条章鱼触手取代，吸盘处生有带齿的嘴巴。这不仅让他们每轮能发动八次攻击（或进行一次极为强力的擒抱），还使他们能如鱼得水般畅游。 This wizard’s lower body has been replaced with eight octopus arms, with toothy mouths in place of suckers. In addition to giving them eight attacks each round (or one REALLY good grapple), this allows them to swim like the dickens."
71	"通过快速吸收灵魂的过程，这位巫师在每次杀人后都能恢复至满血并恢复全部施法能力。 By a process of rapid soul absorption, this wizard is able to return to full health and full spellcasting capacity whenever they kill someone."
72	"无论这位法师走到哪里，人们都能听到主题音乐。这使得他在大多数人眼中显得异常酷炫或令人畏惧。 Wherever this wizard goes, people hear theme music. It makes them seem crazy cool / intimidating to most folks."
73	"这位巫师能在元素层面理解所有交流。即便是十分钟前才发明的秘密语言，他们也能在听到/看到/感受到的瞬间立即理解。 This wizard understands all communication on an elemental level. Even if it is a secret language invented 10 minutes ago, they will understand it instantly upon hearing / seeing / feeling it."
74	"由于一个措辞不当的许愿，这位法师每天都要经历两次。第一次正常度过，第二次则带着第一次的记忆重过。你可以简单地让法师表现得仿佛知道玩家们即将说/做的一切，或者实实在在地让每次与这位法师的遭遇都发生两次，一次接一次。这虽然也让玩家们知道接下来会发生什么，但可能会更有趣。 Due to an awkwardly mis-worded Wish, this wizard lives each day of their life twice. The first time they live it normally, and the second time they live it with memories of the first time. You can model this either by simply running the wizard as if they’re aware of everything the players are going to say/do, or you might literally run any encounter with this wizard twice, one after the other. This does allow the players to also know what’s going on, but will probably be more fun."
75	"当你在参加派对时，这位巫师在研究回旋镖。每当他施放的法术未命中目标或被抵抗时，该法术将在d4轮后“返回”。返回时，它仍有机会像第一次一样影响其预定目标。 While you were going to parties this wizard studied the boomerang. Anytime they cast a spell which is misses its target, or is saved against, that same spell will “return” d4 rounds later. When it does, it gets the same chance to affect its intended target that it had the first time."
76	"任何在这位法师面前说谎或半真半假的人都会立即坦白。无法豁免。“不，我没偷你的金子。顺便说一句，我在撒谎。” Anyone who tells a lie or half truth in the presence of this wizard will immediately confess to it. There is no save. “No, I did not steal your gold. By the way, I’m lying.”"
77	"这位巫师拥有2d6种形态，每种形态都有独特的身体和独立的生活，巫师可以随意在它们之间切换。 This wizard has 2d6 forms, each with a distinct body and a life of their own, which the wizard can switch between at will."
78	"任何触碰法师的人必须进行豁免检定。若失败，他们将被完全吸收进法师体内，直到法师选择释放他们或法师死亡为止。 Anyone who touches the wizard must make a saving throw. On failure, they will be absorbed fully into the wizard’s body and remain trapped there until the wizard chooses to free them, or the wizard dies."
79	"这位巫师体内寄生了寄生虫。任何进入巫师10英尺范围内的人也会被感染。这些活跃的小生物能跳跃很远距离寻找新宿主。被巫师寄生虫感染的人无法对其法术进行豁免检定。此外，如果巫师想找到他们，追踪起来也轻而易举。 This wizard is infested with parasites. Anyone who gets within 10′ of the wizard becomes infected as well. The jumpy little creatures are able to leap great distances to find a new host. Those afflicted with the wizard’s parasites receive no saving throw against that wizard’s spells. They’re also easy to track if the wizard ever wishes to find them."
80	"与一名小魔鬼签订合同时未能正确书写细节，使这位巫师获得了一种特殊保护，免受任何不直接降低生命值的伤害。巫师不会受到属性伤害、非致命伤害、负向等级等影响。 A failure to properly dot the i’s and cross the t’s in a contract with a minro devil has given this wizard a peculiar protection against any form of harm which does not directly lower their hit points. The wizard cannot take ability damage, nonlethal damage, negative levels, etc."
81	"这位法师只需打个响指，便能凭空召唤出任何他们想要的动物。一次只能召唤一只生物。这些生物经过训练，聪明且忠诚，但在存在期间与普通动物无异。 A snap of the fingers allows this wizard to conjure any animal they desire out of thin air. They may only conjure one creature at a time. The creatures are trained, intelligent, and loyal, but are otherwise regular animals for as long as they exist."
82	"这位法师所见所闻皆被记录，日后可通过其口眼投射的魔法影像重现。 Anything seen or heard by this wizard is recorded, and can be replayed later via magical projections from their mouth and eyes."
83	"这位巫师因其大众娱乐作品而小有名气。或许他们撰写了一系列冒险小说，或在滑稽剧中演出，或主持一档晨间谈话节目。无论是什么，他们无论走到哪里都常被认出并受到追捧。人们都喜欢他们。 This wizard is something of a celebrity for their works of popular entertainment. Perhaps they write a series of adventure novels, or act in funny plays, or have a morning talk show. Whatever it is, they’re often recognized and adulated wherever they go. People like them."
84	"这位巫师其实是位仙子。或许他们用幻术伪装成其他模样。其真实形态是一只长着翅膀的微小生物，能以惊人速度四处飞舞，几乎无法捕捉。 This wizard is a fairy. Perhaps they disguise themselves with illusions to look otherwise. Their true form is a tiny winged creature that’s able to dart about at incredible speeds, and is almost impossible to catch."
85	"当这位法师大笑时，所有人都会不由自主地跟着笑，并且必须进行一次豁免检定。失败者即使在法师平静下来后仍会继续大笑。他们每分钟可重新进行一次豁免检定，直到成功为止。此能力仅在法师真诚大笑时生效，无法强行触发。 When this wizard laughs everyone laughs along with them, and must make a saving throw. Those who fail will continue laughing even after the wizard calms down. They’re able to make a new saving throw every minute, and the laughing fit continues until they succeed. This ability only works if the wizard is laughing sincerely. They can’t force it."
86	"这位法师身上长满苔藓，通过光合作用为身体提供养分。只要站在阳光下，他们就能无需消耗已准备的法术来施法。 Moss grows across this wizard’s body, feeding photosynthesized nutrients into their body. So long as they stand in sunlight, they can cast their prepared spells without expending them."
87	"这位巫师是一位重要的历史人物，他伪造了自己的死亡，以免他人发现他是不朽之身。 This wizard is a major historical figure who faked their own death so no one would realize they were immortal."
88	"这位巫师发现证据表明自己将成为重要的历史人物。在未来的某个时刻，他将穿越时空回到遥远的过去度过余生。若他被杀或阻止此举，现有时间线将被抹消。 This wizard has uncovered evidence that they will be a major historical figure. At some point in their future they will tumble backwards through time and live out the rest of their days in the distant past. If they are killed or prevented from doing so, the extant timeline will be undone."
89	"这位法师通过大量实验性手术，为自己打造了可拆卸的四肢。他们的手臂和腿能像脱外套一样轻松取下，并拥有一整套专用替换件可供选择。 An absolutely obscene amount of experimental surgery has allowed this wizard to craft detachable limbs for themselves. Their arms and legs can be taken off as easily as a coat, and they have a whole wardrobe of specialized options to replace them with."
90	"这名法师的颅骨内植入了用于控制轨道激光的赛博格装置。技术虽粗糙且破损，太阳能电池需长时间充电，但一旦充能完毕，只需凝视目标并按特定模式眨眼即可将其熔化。 Cybernetic implants for controlling an orbital laser have been installed in this wizard’s skull. The tech is janky and busted, so it takes awhile for the solar cells to recharge, but when they do it’s as simple as looking at what they want to melt, and blinking in a certain pattern."
91	"若此法师被杀，末日装置将启动。或许是一枚巨型炸弹，或是即将释放入水源的病毒。若他们看似有生命危险，法师必定会提及此事。 A doomsday device will activate if this wizard is killed. Perhaps it’s a huge bomb, or a virus ready to release into the water supply. If it looks like they may be in mortal danger, the wizard will definitely mention this."
92	"谈论这位巫师时，不提他们的性感简直是不可能的。不知为何，他们浪费了一个愿望在这上面。他们可能是世界历史上最伟大的反派，但任何人试图这么说时，都会发现自己补充道：“他们是世界历史上最伟大的反派，但他们的翘臀确实让人难以忘怀。” It is literally impossible to talk about this wizard without mentioning how sexy they are. For some reason they wasted a wish on this. They can be the greatest villain in the history of the world, but if anyone tries to say that they’ll find themselves saying: “They’re the greatest villain in the history of the world, but they do have a tuchus that just won’t quit.”"
93	"这位巫师在皮肤下种下了种子，这些种子以巫师的血液为养分长成小植物。它们可被采摘用于各种炼金、医药和娱乐用途。 This wizard has planted seeds under their skin, which grow into little plants fed by a wizard’s blood. They can be plucked for all manner of alchemical, medicinal, and recreation purposes."
94	"这位法师臀部内的腺体分泌出一种白色排泄物，用以标记领地。其他法师若靠近这些排泄物50英尺内会感到恶心，30英尺内则会剧烈不适。这些排泄物需数周后才会失去效力。 A gland inside this wizard’s bum secretes a white dropping, which the wizard uses to mark their territory. Other wizards become nauseated if they come within 50 feet of these droppings, and violently ill if they come within 30 feet. The lose potency only after several weeks."
95	"宇宙基本法则要求任何与这位巫师打交道的人都必须遵守严格的荣誉准则。不得撒谎、欺骗或使用卑鄙的战斗手段。试图违抗这一指令犹如对抗重力，你可以学会在其中运作，但无法忽视它。 Fundamental cosmic statutes require anyone dealing with this wizard to abide by a strict code of honor. No lying, no cheating, no underhanded combat maneuvers. Attempting to defy this mandate is like trying to defy gravity. You can learn to work within it, but you can’t ignore it."
96	"这位巫师的眼睛能轻易穿透固体表面。对他们来说，这就像我们调整视线从手到地平线一样简单。 This wizard’s eyes are able to look through solid surfaces with ease. For them it is as simple as focusing past the object, the way we might shift our focus between our own hand, and the horizon."
97	"这位法师的袖中能随意涌出易燃油，流速极快，且只要他们愿意，油流就会持续不断。 Flammable oil pours out of this wizard’s sleeves at will. It comes out quite fast, and will continue pouring for as long as they desire."
98	"这位巫师在某个地方停留得越久，该地就会变得[越冷/越热]。他们成长于一个极其[寒冷/炎热]的环境中，远超人类通常认为的宜居范围。他们会对新的温度感到相当舒适，但对大多数人来说，这将是难以忍受的。 The longer this wizard stays in a given place, the [Colder / Hotter] it gets. They were raised in an incredibly [Cold / Hot] environment. One far outside the range humans generally consider habitable. They will be quite comfortable in the new temperature, but for most folks it will be intolerable."
99	"每当这位巫师对某人说“别再淘气了”，对方必须进行一次对抗麻痹的豁免检定。若失败，他们将突然被凭空出现的BDSM装备完全束缚，几乎无法动弹，甚至可能被固定在某种挑逗的姿势中。 Whenever this wizard tells someone to “Stop being naughty,” they must make a saving throw versus parallelization. If they fail, they will find themselves suddenly and completely restrained by BDSM gear that appears around them as if from nowhere. It leaves them with almost no range of movement at all, and quite possibly stuck in some provocative posture."
100	"每当这位法师想要逃跑时，他们都能从口袋里掏出一把珍贵的红宝石抛向身后。这些宝石是真实的，但这种奇特魔法的性质意味着它们只在法师试图逃跑时才会出现。若因其他原因伸手入袋，红宝石将不复存在。 Whenever this wizard wishes to flee, they can reach into their pockets and pull out a fist full of valuable rubies to toss behind them. They are real, but the peculiar nature of this magic means they only come into existence when the wizard is trying to flee. If they reach into their pockets for any other reason the rubies will not be there."
101	"非凡的体力。这位法师能够徒手投掷巨石或击穿石墙。 Phenomenal physical strength. This Wizard can hurl great boulders or punch through stone walls with their bare hands."
102	"这位巫师的头颅光秃，布满数十只眼睛。他们不仅能全方位视物，每只眼睛还能对注视的目标发射灼热光束，造成1d4点伤害。 This Wizard’s head is bald, and covered with dozens of eyes. Not only can they see in every direction, but each eye can emit a beam of burning light at whatever it looks at, dealing 1d4 damage."
103	"若站在至少齐腰深的水中，巫师不会受到任何伤害。他们从水中汲取生命力，拥有100点的快速恢复效果。 If standing in water of at least waist-depth, the Wizard can suffer no wounds. They draw vitality from the water, and have an effective fast healing of 100."
104	"法师的双臂能像弹性材料般伸展，可延伸至身体外100英尺，朝任意方向弯曲，且无论手臂离身体多远，力量丝毫不减。 The Wizard’s arms can stretch out, as though they were made of some elastic material. They can reach up to 100′ away from their bodies, bend their arms in any direction they require, and do not lose any of their strength regardless of how far their arm is from their body."
105	"这位法师呼出的并非一氧化碳，而是一种对其自身免疫的毒气。在开阔地带，这种效果轻微，不值一提。然而，若角色与法师在密闭空间共处超过1d4轮，则每轮需进行对抗毒素的豁免检定。每次失败将导致随机一项能力值暂时减少1d4点。 Rather than carbon monoxide, this Wizard exhales a poison gas to which they are immune. In the open this effect is mild and not worth mentioning. However, if a character is in an enclosed space with the Wizard for longer than 1d4 rounds, they must begin making a save versus Poison each round. Each failure results in a temporary -1d4 to a random ability score."
106	"通过操控时间本身的构造，巫师成功创造了一个能让未来科技存在的时空泡。巫师可能携带任何数量的未来奇物：枪支、智能手机、无人机、轻质防弹装甲等。若巫师死亡，所有这些科技将回归其正确的时间线。从我们的视角看，它们将直接消失。 By manipulating the fabric of time itself, the wizard has managed to create a bubble in which future technology can exist. The Wizard may carry any number of future oddities: a gun, a smartphone, a drone, lightweight bulletproof armor, etc. If the Wizard dies, all this technology will realign with its proper time frame. From our perspective, it will simply disappear."
107	"巫师无法自然死亡，除非遭受致命伤害，否则将永生。他们可能已经活了数百年，甚至数千年。 The Wizard cannot die a natural death, and will live until some mortal harm befalls them. They may now have already lived for centuries, or even millennia."
108	"法师的血液已被替换为一种受压气体，接触空气时会点燃。对法师的任何穿刺或刺穿伤害都会导致一股火焰喷发。形成30英尺的锥形区域，对区域内所有人造成等同于法师剩余生命值的伤害。进行对抗龙息的豁免检定，成功则伤害减半。 The blood of the Wizard has been replaced by a pressurized gas that ignites when it contacts the air. Any puncturing or piercing wound against the wizard will result in a gout of flame. A 30′ cone, dealing damage equal to the Wizard’s remaining health to anyone within its area. Save versus Breath for half damage."
109	"巫师的皮肤无法被任何方式割伤，除非他们自愿。仍可受到钝击，但不会破裂。因此，劈砍或穿刺武器造成的伤害大幅减少。 The Wizard’s skin cannot be cut by any means, unless they are willing. It may still be bludgeoned, but it will not break. Slashing or piercing weapons deal a greatly reduced amount of damage because of this."
110	"重力似乎对这位法师无效。他们漂浮着，通过一种机制保持接近地面，但可以随时脱离以自由飘浮。他们已熟练于借助墙壁反弹、跃出攻击范围，并巧妙地利用这一特质发挥最大优势。 Gravity does not appear to affect this Wizard. They drift, keeping near the ground by a mechanism from which they can easily detach if they wish to float freely. They have become skilled at bouncing off of walls, leaping out of range, and otherwise using this affliction to their best advantage."
111	"在时间停滞的异次元空间中完成了超乎想象的深蹲训练后，这位法师如今能跃至100英尺高空。无论从多高处坠落，他们都不会受到任何跌落伤害。即便从轨道上坠落，只要他们能设法在穿越大气层时存活，也同样安然无恙。 After performing more squats than you could ever fathom in a time-stopped pocket dimension, this Wizard can now leap up to 100′ in the air. Regardless of how high they fall from, they will never suffer any damage from a fall. Even if they were to fall from orbit, assuming they had some way of surviving entry through the atmosphere."
112	"这位法师能够“凭耳”施法。若他们拥有足够高等级的空法术位，且目睹了某个法术的施放，该法术便会出现在他们的空法术位中。他们可以如常施放，或保留至稍后轻松地将其抄录进法术书。 The Wizard can cast spells “by ear,” as it were. If they have an empty spell slot of sufficiently high level, and they see a spell cast, then that spell will appear in their empty spell slot. They can cast it as normal, or keep it until later to inscribe into their spellbook without any difficulty."
113	"通过观察一个人，这位法师能深刻理解其宗教信仰，甚至可能比本人更了解。法师常借此假扮神明或先知。一旦失去对某人的视线，关于其宗教的知识会在几小时后逐渐消失。 By looking at a person, this Wizard gains an intimate understanding of that person’s religion, probably knowing even more about it than they do. The Wizard often uses this to impersonate deities and prophets. A few hours after losing sight of a person, knowledge of that person’s religion fades."
114	"巫师身边伴随着一位（1. 亲密朋友，2. 爱人，3. 忠诚的附庸，4. 魔法契约的奴隶），其身份是（1. 牛头人，2. 魅魔，3. 角魔，4. 巨人，5. 恐龙，6. 龙） The Wizard is accompanied by a (1. Close Friend, 2. Lover, 3. Devoted Vassal, 4. Magically bonded slave) who is a (1. Minotaur, 2.Succubus, 3. Horned Devil, 4. Giant, 5. Dinosaur, 6. Dragon)"
115	"这位法师在完全无关的职业生涯中拥有绝对的专家级经验，他们在追求神秘艺术之前曾投入数十年时间。（1. 航海，2. 政治，3. 美术，4. 自然哲学，5. 历史，6. 工程，7. 驯兽，8. 金属工艺） The Wizard has absolute mastery-level experience in a completely unrelated career, which they spent decades in prior to pursuing the mystic arts. (1. Sailing, 2. Politics, 3. Fine Arts, 4. Natural Philosophy, 5. History, 6. Engineering, 7. Beast Taming, 8. Metalcrafting)"
116	"这位法师完全不需要睡眠，他们充满紧张的能量，即使在休息时间也能极其高效地利用。这使得他们能够在不影响魔法修习的同时，训练第二职业。他们获得第二职业的所有好处，其等级大约是他们魔法使用者职业等级的一半。（1.牧师 2-3.战士 4-5.专家 6.某些奇特职业。比如本网站上的自定义职业之一。） Sleep is completely unnecessary for this Wizard, and they are filled with a nervous energy that makes even their downtime insanely productive. This has allowed them to train a second class without impacting their Wizardly pursuits. They get all the benefits of their second class, which has roughly half the number of levels that they have in the Magic User class. (1. Cleric 2-3. Fighter 4-5. Specialist 6. Something weird. Like one of the custom classes on this site.)"
117	"法师的言语带有魔力，使其说出的任何命令都具有命令法术的效力。 The Wizard’s speech has a magical charge, making any command they utter have the force of a Command spell."
118	"魔法飞弹卷轴被纹在法师的每一根手指上。他们每天能够施放该法术10次，无需消耗任何法术位来记忆它。 Magic Missile scrolls are tattooed up and down each of the Wizard’s digits. They are able to cast the spell 10 times per day without expending any of their spell slots on memorizing it."
119	"这位法师已完成成为巫妖所需的99%过程，其命匣已然存在，唯一欠缺的便是死亡。他们并不急于赴死，但一旦死去，便将重生为巫妖。 The Wizard has already undergone 99% of the process required to become a lich. Their phylactery already exists, and the only thing left is for them to die. They’re in no hurry to do it, but when they do die, they’ll just be reborn as a lich."
120	"法师的胡须并非由普通毛发构成，而是由（1.触手，2.蛇，3.昆虫腿，4.粘液，5.火焰，6.可操控的毛发）组成。这里有1d4根足够长的触须可以进行攻击。若法师为女性，则此效果从她的（1.腋下，2.私处，3.她依然有胡须，4.她以此替代胸部）长出。无论如何，头部毛发不可用于此效果。 The Wizard’s beard is not made of normal hair, but of (1. Tentacles, 2. Snakes, 3. Insectile Legs, 4. Ooze, 5. Fire, 6. Prehensile Hair). There are 1d4 tendrils from here which are long enough to make attacks. If the Wizard is of a feminine persuasion, then instead of a beard this effect sprouts from her (1. Underarms, 2. Bush, 3. she just has a beard anyway, 4. She has this instead of boobs) Under no circumstances may head hair be used."
121	"巫师对（1.火焰，2.寒冷，3.酸液，4.电击）造成的任何伤害（1.减半抵抗，2.完全免疫，3.吸收一半，4.完全吸收）。 The Wizard is (1. Resistant by half, 2. Immune, 3. Absorbs half, 4. Absorbs fully.) any damage which might reasonably be attributed to (1. Fire, 2. Cold, 3. Acid, 4. Electricity)."
122	"通过将众多幽灵婴儿的灵质融入体内，巫师能够随意使自己的身体化为无形。 By suffusing their body with the ectoplasm of numerous spectral infants, the Wizard is able to turn their body incorporeal at will."
123	"法师的外貌可变，能随意模仿任何人类，或凭空塑造全新形象。 The Wizard’s appearance is fungible. They can alter it to resemble any human they choose, or create an entirely new appearance for themselves out of scratch."
124	"这位法师以众多化名掌控着多个组织，从看似无足轻重的小镇地方政府，到大城市的行会、有组织犯罪团伙，乃至雇佣兵团。 Under numerous aliases, this Wizard controls numerous organizations. Everything from local governments of seemingly unimportant towns, to big city guilds, to organized crime, to mercenary bands."
125	"巫师散发出类似魅惑人类法术效果的费洛蒙。任何能闻到的人必须进行豁免检定。 The Wizard exudes pheromones with similar effect to a Charm Person spell. Anyone who can smell them must save."
126	"从袖中，法师能取出任何非魔法、非特定的、能放入袖中的物品。例如，他们可以掏出一只表查看时间，但不能取出能停止时间的魔法表，或你刚说愿出重金赎回的你父亲的手表。 From their sleeve the Wizard can pull any nonmagical, nonspecific object that would fit in a sleeve. So for example, they can pull out a watch to check the time, but cannot pull out a magical watch that stops time, or your father’s watch that you just said you’d pay a fortune to have back."
127	"巫师拥有一根16英尺长的可卷曲阴茎，能缠绕并挤压受害者致死；或拥有一对充满酸液的乳房，可随意喷射15英尺锥形范围。巫师拥有哪种能力与其性别无关。 The Wizard has eithera 16′ long prehensile penis that can entangle and compress victims to death; or they have a pair of acid-filled tits which can spray in a 15′ cone at will. Which one the Wizard has is irrespective of their gender."
128	"巫师毛孔渗出一种黏稠油脂，使其异常滑溜。巫师借此如穿溜冰鞋般滑行，挣脱任何束缚，并以惊人速度游泳。 The pores of the Wizard ooze a kind of gooey oil which makes them incredibly slippery. The Wizard uses this to slid around as though on skates, escape any bonds ever put on them, and to swim with incredible speed."
129	"环境因素对这位法师毫无影响。他们能在水下呼吸，在暴风雪中自我取暖，在火山内部自我降温。这种对自然元素的防护包括任何魔法施加的环境，但不保护他们免受范围法术的影响。 Environmental concerns are of no concern to this Wizard. They can breathe under water, self-heat themselves in a blizzard, and self-cool themselves inside a volcano. This safety from the elements includes any magically imposed environments, but does not protect them from area of effect spells."
130	"法师的舌头上镶嵌着一颗宝石。若在明亮处伸出舌头，宝石会折射出七彩光芒，形成一个15尺见方的光域，笼罩并包含其中的一切。此光域可置于法师位置20尺内的任意地点。 A gem is embeded into the Wizard’s tongue. If they stick out their tongue while standing in a brightly lit area, a prism of color will refract out of the gem. This light eill envelope and contain everything in a 15′ square. The square may be placed anywhere within 20′ of the Wizard’s location."
131	"任何（1-2. 男性，3-4. 女性）与巫师相遇的人都会立即爱上他们。无需进行豁免检定，他们只会希望巫师好，并寻求巫师的认可。无性别的生物对此效果免疫。 Any (1-2. Man, 3-4. Woman) encountered by the Wizard will instantly fall in love with them. There is no save involved, and they will wish only good things for the Wizard, seeking their approval. Any creature without gender is immune to this effect."
132	"巫师知晓人类构造的秘密。他们能够在大约一周的时间内，从基本元素中完整构建出一个成年人。这些人类独立自主，但大多数人显然承认他们欠创造者一份显著的恩情，并选择为巫师服务。其中一些人会伴随巫师左右。 The secret of human construction is known to the Wizard. Over the course of about a week, they are able to fully construct an adult human from component elements. These humans are independent, but obviously most of them accept that they owe some notable debt to their creator, and choose to serve the Wizard. Several of these will accompany the Wizard."
133	"实际上，这具身体内容纳了2d2个法师的意识，因在外层位面旅行时遭遇的某种灾难而共享一体。每个意识都拥有完整的法术列表，随时可施法。不过，身体一次可能只能施放一个法术。 There are actually 2d2 Wizard’s minds contained within this single body, shared due to some catastrophe while traveling the outer planes. Each of the minds possesses a full spell list, ready to cast. The body can only cast one spell at a time, probably."
134	"巫师能像奔腾的马一样奔跑，且在此过程中永不疲倦。 The Wizard is able to run as fast as a galloping horse, and never tires of their exertion in this regard."
135	"巫师能够无限制地频繁且长时间地以念力移动物体，可移动重量为（1. 10磅，2-4. 80磅，5-6. 200磅），移动方式为（1. 缓慢但极为精准，2. 缓慢且笨拙，3-5. 快速但依然笨拙，6. 快速且精准）。 The Wizard is able to move objects telekinetically, without any limit on how frequently or how long they can do so. They can move up to (1. 10lb, 2-4. 80lb, 5-6. 200lb), (1. Slowly, but with great precision. 2. Slowly and clumsily, 3-5. With great speed, but still clumsily 6. With great speed and precision)"
136	"法师的双手可拆卸，之后会活化成为其仆从，具备飞行能力。约一轮后，法师的断腕处会长出新的双手。拆下的双手将在1d6轮后枯萎死亡。 The Wizard’s hands can be detached, and will then animate to act as the Wizard’s servitors, with the ability to fly. New hands will grow on the Wizard’s stumps after about 1 turn. The detached hands will wither and die after 1d6 turns."
137	"这位法师拥有超人般的超级呼吸能力，能呼出如暴风雪般寒冷、飓风般强劲的气流。只要他们能深吸一口气，便可随时施展此技。因此，最多每2d4轮可使用一次，若因剧烈体力活动而疲惫则无法施展。 The Wizard is possessed of Superman-style Super-Breath. Hurricane force winds as cold as a blizzard. They can do this as often as they’re able to get a really deep, satisfying breath. So, at most, every 2d4 rounds, and never if they’re exhausted from heavy physical activity."
138	"巫师拥有欧米伽凝视。每10分钟回合可使用一次，凝视将锁定目标直至必定命中。光束造成2d12点伤害，但通过装置检定可使伤害减半。 The Wizard has an Omega Gaze. They may use it once per 10 minute turn, and it will follow its target until it strikes them without fail. The beams deal 2d12 damage, but a save versus Device will reduce the damage by half."
139	"一位强大的生物欠法师一个人情，会在被召唤时前来相助（1. 精灵，2. 吸血鬼，3. 一只巨大的智慧狮子，4. 一条远古巨龙。） A powerful creature owes the Wizard a favor, and will come to their aide when summoned (1. Djinn, 2. Vampire, 3. A titanic intelligent lion 4. An elder dragon.)"
140	"如同艾恩石一般，一扇微小的门环绕着他们的身体。他们可以随意用手将门拉开至足以步入的大小。这扇门通向一个口袋维度，里面存放着众多武器与珍宝。其中许多物品只需在门处于迷你状态时伸手进入即可轻易取出，因此这位法师从未真正手无寸铁。 Like an ioun stone, a tiny door orbits their bodies. At will they may use their hands to pull the door wide enough to step through. It leads into a pocket dimension where they store numerous weapons and treasures. Many of these can easily be removed merely by reaching into the door while it is in its miniaturized state, so that the Wizard is never truly unarmed."
141	"石头与巫师对话，并回应他的提问。它们虽不能代表巫师行动，却对周遭发生之事了如指掌。 Stones speak to the Wizard, and respond to his questions. They cannot act on the Wizard’s behalf, but they know much of what happens around them."
142	"这位法师知晓自己身处游戏中，对于意外闯入主舞台感到恼火。他熟知游戏的所有规则，并渴望尽快摆脱聚光灯，回归无人想象时的生活。他认为与角色对话是一种侮辱，只愿直接与玩家和裁判交流。 The Wizard knows they are in a game, and is annoyed that they’ve accidentally wandered onto the main stage. They know all of the rules of the game, and would like to extricate themselves from the spotlight as soon as possible so they can go back to whatever they do when no one is imagining them. Considers it an insult to speak to characters, and will speak only to players and to the referee directly."
143	"几年前，这位法师曾短暂地达到了神格境界。由于众神不愿接纳如此傲慢的凡人，他被击落凡间；但他保留了一丝神性的残余（1. 对生命值伤害免疫，2. 知晓世界上超过五个人所知的任何事物，3. 能够按照自己的意愿塑造环境，4. 能够抹杀在他面前亵渎他的人。） For a brief moment the Wizard achieved godhood a few years ago. They were knocked back down to earth by a pantheon unwilling to accept such a pompous little mortal into their midst; but they retained one minor vestige of their divinity (1. Invulnerability to hit point damage, 2. They know everything that more than five people in the world know. 3. The ability to shape their environment to suit their will 4. The ability to un-make anyone who blasphemes them in their presence.)"
144	"这位法师已超越其肉体形态，却仍困于躯壳之中。死亡将释放他们，达到更高存在形式。掷硬币决定法师是否知晓此事。 This Wizard has already evolved beyond their physical form, but are still muddling about in their physical bodies. Death would release them to achieve some higher form of existence. Flip a coin to determine if the Wizard knows this."
145	"每当法师说出一个角色的全名，便获得1点对该角色的控制力。此信息保密，但玩家可能会察觉到他们名字被刻意重复的诡异方式。法师可随意激活此力量，每点控制力造成1点伤害。若角色因此死亡，则成为法师的亡灵仆从，虽保留全部能力，却必须服从法师命令，身体逐渐腐烂。法师需先知晓名字才能说出，且说出时目标必须能听见才有效。若一天内未使用，控制力将消散。 Each time the Wizard says a character’s full name, they gain 1 point of power over that character. This information is kept secret, though players might notice the creepily deliberate way their names are being repeated. At will, the Wizard may activate this power. Each point of power deals 1 point of damage, and if a character is killed in this way, they become an undead servant of the wizard. They fully retain their faculties, but must obey the wizard’s commands as their body slowly rots. The Wizard must know a name before they can speak it, and when spoken, it must be audible to the target in order to count. After a day, if they are unused, points of power fade away."
146	"法师能够分身两地。此时，他们完全同时存在于两个不同的地方。若其中一个被摧毁，另一个依然完整无缺，因为两者皆为整体。当法师的两个分身合二为一时，他们将融合，从而这位单一的法师将拥有两段同时发生的经历。 The Wizard may bilocate. While doing so, they exist fully in two different places at once. If one is destroyed, it does not matter, because the other is no less of the whole. When the two instances of the Wizard come together, they may combine, and thus the single Wizard will have lived a pair of simultaneous experiences."
147	"火焰听从法师的指挥，会朝其指示的方向蔓延。它还能根据法师的意愿变换形状、闪烁、冒烟或闷烧。 Fire obeys the Wizard, and will spread in the direction they indicate. It may also take on shapes, flare, smoke, or smoulder at the Wizard’s behest."
148	"巫师的身体如同魔法海绵，吸引所有神秘能量。在此巫师面前，除其自身引导能量的魔法物品或法术外，其他皆无法生效。 The body of the Wizard is like a magical sponge. It draws all mystic energy into itself. While in the presence of this Wizard, no magic items or magic spells will work, save those that the Wizard is channeling their own energies into."
149	"这位法师拥有许多蜘蛛的特性。他们能从指尖吐丝，攀爬墙壁，以极快的速度和敏捷移动，力量远超常人，且感官异常敏锐。简而言之，这位法师就是蜘蛛侠。 The Wizard is posessed of many of the properties of spiders. They are able to spin webs from their fingertips. climb walls, move with great speed and agility, are much strong than they ought to be, and have incredibly accute senses. This Wizard is spider-man, is what I’m saying."
150	"任何生物都无法对法师采取暴力行为，无论出于何种原因。若法师先采取暴力行为，则区域内对魔法抗性最强的生物可尝试进行一次豁免。若成功，该生物可采取暴力行为，随后对魔法抗性次弱的生物可尝试类似的豁免。以此类推，直至有生物豁免失败，此后其他生物均无法尝试豁免。 No creature can bring itself to act violently against the Wizard, for any reason. If the Wizard acts violently first, then whomever in the area has the strongest save versus Magic may attempt a save. If they succeed, then they can act violently, and whomever has the next weakest save versus Magic may attempt a similar save. So on and so forth, until someone fails a save, at which point no one else may attempt one."
151	"这位法师身高九尺，拥有举重运动员般的力量与体质。他们气势逼人，根据其等级与生命骰，拥有可能达到的最大生命值。 This Wizard stands 9′ tall, with the strength and constitution of a weight lifter. They’re an imposing figure, with the maximum hit points that they could possibly have given their level and hit dice."
152	"任何拥有贵族血统的人都深信自己与这位巫师有着美好的回忆。初次见到这位巫师时，他们会想起巫师曾为他们表演小把戏，以及曾代表他们对抗愤怒的父母。这些记忆永不褪色，巫师发现从上层阶级那里获得任何所需都轻而易举。 Anybody with any manner of noble pedigree believes they have fond memories of this Wizard. Upon seeing this Wizard for the first time they will remember when the Wizard used to perform little tricks for them, and when they stood up to an angry parent on the noble child’s behalf. These memories will never fade, and The Wizard finds it quite easy to get any favor they need from the upper classes."
153	"这位巫师的名字蕴含强大力量。他们绝不敢让任何人知晓，因为一旦有人得知其名，便能对巫师的魔法免疫。 The name of this Wizard is very powerful. They dare never let anyone know it, for if someone knows their name, they become immune to the Wizard’s magic."
154	"这位巫师曾欺骗并杀害了神的使者。他们窃取了这半神生物的喉咙，如今每当他们说话时，颈间皮肤下便泛起蓝白微光。他们所言无不引人入胜，每句笑话令人捧腹，每次演讲动人心弦，每首诗篇催人泪下。他们的言辞总能达到最理想的效果。 This Wizard tricked and slew god’s own messenger. They stole the throat of this semi-divine creature, and now a tinge of blue and white glows beneath the skin of their neck when they speak. Everything they say is completely captivating. Every joke riotously funny, every speech moving, every poem will move an audience to tears. Their words always have the best possible effect that was intended."
155	"他们拥有一种视觉能力（1. 将人冻结在原地，2. 将人石化，3. 将人变成心灵奴隶，4. 与目标交换灵魂）。此效果可通过魔法豁免来避免。此能力可使用（1. 每回合一次，2-3. 每三回合一次，4-6. 每日1d6次）。 They have vision which (1. Freezes people in place, 2. Turns people to stone, 3. Turns people into their mind-slaves 4. Switches souls with the target). The effect can be avoided with a save versus Magic. This ability may be used (1. Every round, 2-3. Every 3rd round, 4-6. 1d6 times per day)"
156	"巫师的双脚从不触地，他们能毫不费力地四处飞行。 The Wizard’s feet never touch the ground. They fly everywhere effortlessly."
157	"这位法师能够随心所欲地增长至泰坦般大小（20-30英尺高），或缩小至昆虫尺寸。 The wizard is able to grow to the size of a titan (20-30′ tall), or to the size of an insect at will."
158	"巫师永久具备与（1.植物 2.动物 3.所有常见种族的语言 4.死者）交流的能力。对巫师而言，与这些事物交谈已如本能般自然。 The Wizard is permanently able to speak with (1. Plants 2. Animals 3. All languages of the common races 4. The dead). To the Wizard, being able to speak to these things has become second nature."
159	"每个种族都将这位巫师视为己族一员，无论他们是人类、家猫、地精、龙、巨人还是其他任何生物。 Every race sees the Wizard as a member of their own race. Be they human, house cat, goblin, dragon, giant, or anything else."
160	"这位巫师能够随心所欲地变形为（1.狮子，2.鹰，3.双髻鲨，4.瓢虫，5.鬣蜥，6.眼镜王蛇）。 This Wizard is able to transform into a (1. Lion, 2. Eagle, 3. Hammerhead Shark 4. Ladybug 5. Iguana 6. King Cobra) at will."
161	"这位巫师能够随意化为一滩液体。只要是在下坡或大致平坦的表面上，他们便能移动。这滩液体还能随心所欲地改变形状，例如变作细丝滑过走钢丝，只要钢丝不向上倾斜。 This Wizard can transform into a pool of liquid at will. They can move around so long as they are going downhill, or on a more-or-less even surface. The puddle can also shape itself however it chooses. So it can become a thin strand to slid across a tightrope, so long as that tightrope doesn’t go up."
162	"无论身处何地，巫师总在视野尽头拥有一座华美宅邸。然而，除非巫师正接近或占据它，否则这座宅邸不会存在。每座宅邸都独具特色，装潢奢华，配备齐全，仆从如云，一切皆为真实，甚至可在宅邸消失前被搬离。 Wherever they are, the Wizard always seems to have a fine manse just over the horizon. This manse won’t be there unless the Wizard is approaching or occupying it, however. Each manse is different, filled with fine luxuries, accoutrements, and servants, all of which are real and could potentially be removed from the premises before the manse ceases to exist again."
163	"巫师能像龙一样呼吸。掷骰决定其模仿的龙息类型：（1.红龙，2.黑龙，3.蓝龙，4.白龙，5.绿龙，6.某种极其奇特的龙）。 The Wizard can breathe just like a dragon can. Roll to determine the type of dragon their breath emulates: (1. Red, 2. Black, 3. Blue, 4. White, 5. Green, 6. Something really weird)."
164	"每天早晨，巫师从枕头下取出一本书。这本书总是不同，描述着巫师当天可能面临的新挑战。它不预言未来，只揭示巫师将遭遇的事物。书中的信息与裁判的笔记及在场角色的角色表极为相似。 Each morning the Wizard removes a book from under their pillow. The book is always different, describing whatever new challenges the Wizard may face that day. It does not describe what will happen, only what is in the Wizard’s path. The information in these books looks very much like the referee’s notes, and the character sheets of any characters present at the session."
165	"这位巫师永久隐形，必须穿着全身覆盖物才能显现身形。 This Wizard is permanently invisible, and must wear full-body coverings to appear visible."
166	"所有（1.乌鸦，2.青蛙，3.猪类生物，4.蜘蛛，5.人类儿童，6.鼹鼠，7.鸡，8.雪貂）都会听从法师的精神指令。 All (1. Ravens, 2. Frogs, 3. Porcine Creatures, 4. Spiders 5. Human children 6. Moles 7. Chickens 8. Ferrets) will obey the Wizard’s mental commands."
167	"巫师若愿意，每一步皆可跨越两英里之遥。 The Wizard may travel up to 2 miles with every step they take if they so wish."
168	"巫师的唾液是一种令人愉悦的麻醉剂。他们的身体能精确分泌出足以保持自身亢奋的量，若愿意，他们还能偶尔为他人提供一些唾液。他们是个非常、非常棒的接吻高手。 The Wizard’s saliva is a pleasant narcotic. Their body produces it in perfect amounts to keep them high, and if they want they can spare some spit now and again for other people. They are a really, really good kisser."
169	"一条极其智慧的蛇居住在巫师的臀部内。它向巫师透露信息，令人惊叹的信息。 A serpent of exceeding wisdom lives inside the Wizard’s butt. It tells them things. Amazing things."
170	"这位法师始终激活着一种低阶读心术，能感知周围每个人的表层思维。 The Wizard has a low-level mind read active at all times, allowing them to sense the surface thoughts of everyone around them."
171	"这位法师眼中拥有多种视觉能力：X光视觉、夜视、远视、显微视觉，如此多视觉。 This Wizard has so many kinds of vision up in their eyes. X-Ray vision. Night vision. Far-vision. Micro-vision. So many visions."
172	"这位巫师正在经历这天的第三次循环。他们可以避免2d4次错误。每当裁判认为巫师犯了错误时，他们可以倒转时间至错误发生之时，并做出不同的选择。 This Wizard is currently living through this day for the third time. They can avoid 2d4 mistakes. Anytime the referee feels that the Wizard has made a mistake, they can reverse time to when that mistake was made, and make a different choice."
173	"随机确定队伍中的一名成员。实际上，巫师是该角色的父母。 Randomly determine a member of the party. Secretly, the Wizard is that character’s parent."
174	"若有人直视巫师的眼睛，他们将无法说谎。 If someone looks into the Wizard’s eyes, they are incapable of telling a lie."
175	"这位法师是诱惑的绝对大师，性爱技巧非凡，深知如何在翌日清晨离去时让几乎每个人都感到被欣赏和尊重。这并非魔法，只是他们确实是个令人惊叹的情人。 The Wizard is an absolute master of seduction, is exceptionally good at sex, and knows how to make just about anybody feel appreciated and respected the morning after as the Wizard takes their leave. There’s nothing magical about this, they’re just a really amazing lay."
176	"这位巫师正携带着一件具有改变世界意义的神奇物品，这类物品往往能成为重大冒险的核心目标。巫师今日并无使用此物的计划，甚至可能从未打算使用它。他们或许只想研究它，甚至摧毁它，但如果今天对他们来说足够糟糕的话…… The Wizard currently carries a magic item of world-altering significance. The sort of thing that might serve as the Mcguffin for a huge adventure. The Wizard had no plans to use this item today, and may never have intended to use it. They might intend only to study it, or even to destroy it, but if the day goes poorly enough for them…"
177	"接受这位巫师的雇佣合同是个陷阱，会使雇员陷入几乎无法解除的奴役咒语，唯有诱使巫师说出“十一”才能破解。 Accepting employment contracts from this Wizard is a trap. It places the employee under a nearly unbreakable spell of servitude which can only be broken if the Wizard can be tricked into saying “eleven.”"
178	"法师正在从未知地点进行星界投射，持续时间之久，以至于其灵魂已围绕自身生长出一具新的肉体，并忘记了真实身体的位置。若当前身体被杀，他们将瞬间返回真实身体所在之处。需注意，当前身体可能与真实身体在外貌上截然不同，甚至年龄、性别或种族也可能相异。 The Wizard is currently astral-projecting themselves from an unknown location. They’ve been doing so for so long that their spirit has grown a new physical body around itself, and they’ve forgotten where their true body is. If their current body is killed, they will be snapped back to their actual body’s current location. Note that their current body need look nothing like their true body, and they may even be a different age, gender, or species."
179	"法师可随意将自身及60尺内的任何人带入一个口袋维度。该维度在有人身处其中时持续存在，外观与法师创造口袋时周围60尺范围内的区域完全相同。 At will, the Wizard can place themselves, and anyone within 60′, inside of a pocket dimension. This dimension lasts for as long as anyone is inside of it, and looks exactly like whatever area was in a 60′ radius of the Wizard when the pocket was created."
180	"巫师身上长有十个小息肉。若割下并掷于地面，这些息肉会瞬间成长为赤裸魁梧的战士，誓死保卫巫师。 10 tiny polyps grow on the Wizard’s body. If cut off and cast to the ground, these instantly grow into naked, burly warriors ready to defend the Wizard with their lives."
181	"巫师拥有粘性唾液。它异常粘稠，能瞬间硬化，且坚韧到足以将砖块的短边固定在墙上。 The Wizard has adhesive spit. It’s remarkably sticky, instantly hardening, and tough enough to hold the short side of a brick to a wall."
182	"这位法师的尿液具有酸性。只有在饮水充足时才能使用，但它几乎能溶解任何东西。 The Wizard has acidic urine. They can only use it if they’ve had enough water, but it’ll melt pretty much anything."
183	"这位法师的粪便具有爆炸性。排泄后约20秒便会引爆，因此必须迅速抛出以免自伤。 The Wizard has explosive poop. It detonates roughly 20 seconds after it is excreted, and thus must be thrown quickly to avoid self-harm."
184	"巫师有4/6的几率在腰带上携带适合任何情况的完美药水。这些药水从不普通，如治疗药水或巨人增长药水。它们异常具体，例如“镣铐破解药水”、“无味屁酊剂”和“驱鲨剂”。 The Wizard has a 4-in-6 chance to have the perfect potion for any situation on their belt. These are never general potions, like healing potions or Giant’s Growth potions. These are bizarrely specific. Stuff like “Potion of Manacle Breaking,” “Tincture of odorless farts,” and “Shark repellent.”"
185	"这位巫师会向遇到的每个人分发名片。若在名片“可听范围”内有人说了有趣的话，这些话就会出现在巫师随身携带的小笔记本上，他们每天早晨喝咖啡时都会翻阅。 This Wizard has business cards which they hand out to everyone they meet. If anything interesting is said within “earshot” of the card, it appears in a little notebook the Wizard carries, which they read through each morning over coffee."
186	"这位法师大脑的很大一部分已被来自异世界的水晶结构所取代。这些水晶极度理性，以截然不同的视角看待世界。法师本人仍表现出情感，因其大脑并未完全消失，但水晶使他在处理逻辑或数学时思维迅捷如电，并拥有完美的图像记忆。 A large portion of this Wizard’s brain has been replaced with a crystalline structure from another world. The crystals are hyper-logical, and view the world through a vastly different lens. The Wizard themselves still displays emotion, as their brain is not completely gone, but the crystals provide them with lightning-fast thinking when processing logic or mathematics, as well as a perfect photographic memory."
187	"这位法师已与水元素融为一体。他们的外表与同族无异，但物体能无害地穿透其身躯，仅留下涟漪。他们可如你所想的水元素般自如行动，施展其所有能力。 The Wizard has fused themselves with a water elemental. Their body appears just like any normal example of their race, but objects pass harmlessly through it, leaving only ripples behind. They may move and act with all of the abilities you would expect from a water elemental."
188	"这位法师挥手之间便能赋予木制品生机。在他周围，任何木制品都会开始长出枝条、萌发新叶，变得不再适合原本的用途。法师自身的装备则由金属、骨头、陶瓷等制成，以避免这一问题。 With a wave of the hand this Wizard may reinvigorate the life in items made from wood. Any within his presence will begin to grow branches and sprout leaves, becoming unsuitable for whatever purpose they originally had. The Wizard’s own equipment is made of metal, bone, ceramic, etc so as to avoid this becoming an issue."
189	"这位巫师不受外来物质影响，毒药无效，但酒类亦无作用。在发生这一变化前，巫师颇爱夜夜狂欢畅饮，如今视其为糟糕的交换。 This Wizard cannot be affected by foreign substances. Poisons have no impact, but neither do intoxicants. The Wizard was quite fond of a night of boozy revelry prior to this alteration, and views it as a poor trade."
190	"这位法师重新排列了自己的内部解剖结构，对致命一击、偷袭以及任何形式的非魔法医疗免疫。 The wizard has rearranged their own internal anatomy. They are immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, and any form of non-magical medicine."
191	"杀死这位法师的人实际上会死去，因为当这位法师被杀时，他们的意识会转移到杀手的身体中。这位法师唯一真正害怕的是意外或老死。 Whoever kills this Wizard is actually the one who dies, for when this Wizard is killed, their mind transfers into the body of their killer. The only thing this Wizard really fears is death by accident or old age."
192	"若此法师触碰你，你的皮肤将显现黑斑。见此斑者皆知你已被标记为必死之人，杀你者不受追究。法官不会判其有罪，且他们有权获得你全部财产，因除你于世乃行善之举。 If this wizard touches you, your skin will display a black spot. Anyone who sees this spot will know you are marked for death and that no one can be prosecuted for killing you. No judge will convict them, and indeed, they will be entitled to all of your property for doing the world a favor by getting rid of you."
193	"这位巫师可以随意点燃食指，仿佛它是烟花棒。他们能在空中书写和绘画，这些图像不会消失，直到他们打个响指。 At will, this Wizard may ignite their index finger as if it were a sparkler. They can then write and draw in mid air, and the images will not disappear until they snap their fingers."
194	"精灵曾在这位巫师吹奏风笛的几周里跳舞，几乎累到虚脱。但精灵们心满意足，作为礼物，他们赐予了巫师极大的幸运。任何与巫师相关的掷骰都必须掷两次，取对巫师更有利的结果。这适用于由巫师或对巫师进行的攻击和伤害掷骰，以及随机表、能力或技能检定，以及任何其他可能发生的掷骰。 The fey folk once danced for weeks while this Wizard played a jig on the pipes which nearly exhausted them to the point of death. But the fey were satisfied, and as a gift they gave the Wizard tremendous luck. Any rolls made in relation to the Wizard must be rolled twice, and the result more beneficial to the Wizard is taken. This goes for attack and damage rolls made by OR against the Wizard, as well as rolls on random tables, ability or skill checks, and any other kind of roll that might occur."
195	"任何触及这位巫师嘴唇的饮用水都会变成甜美的葡萄酒。 Any body of drinking water which touches this Wizard’s lips is turned to a sweet wine."
196	"任何个体直接对该法师造成的伤害也会反噬给该个体。例如，如果你刺伤法师造成4点伤害，你自己也会受到4点刺伤伤害。然而，如果你将法师绑在建筑物内的椅子上，然后点燃建筑物，你不会受到任何伤害。只是别愚蠢地在火势猛烈时将法师推入火中。 Any damage dealt to this Wizard by the direct action of an individual is also dealt to that individual. So if you deal 4 points of damage by stabbing this Wizard, you take 4 points of stabbing damage yourself. If, on the other hand, you tie the Wizard to a chair inside of a building, and then light the building on fire, you will take no damage. Just don’t be dumb and push the wizard into the fire once it’s started blazing."
197	"这位巫师能通过简单的手势控制天气，引导风向特定方向以特定力度吹拂，召唤降雨或冰雹，甚至在风暴真正来临时召唤闪电。 This Wizard can control the weather with simple gestures of their hands, guiding the wind to blow in a given direction with a given amount of force, calling down rain or hail, and even bolts of lightning once a storm has really gotten going."
198	"这位巫师背后长出八条长长的触手状手臂，末端是正常的人手，沿着脊柱平行排列。 This Wizard eight long tentacular arms, ending in normal human hands, growing from their back parallel to their spine."
199	"这位法师与他们实验的生物部分融合，获得了该生物的一些身体特征和天赋。（1. 野兔，2. 乌龟，3. 猎鹰，4. 熊，5. 狗，6. 鬣蜥。） The Wizard has partially fused themselves with a creature they were experimenting on. They’ve taken on some of the physical attributes of this creature, as well as gained some of its talents. (1. Hare, 2. Tortoise, 3. Falcon, 4. Bear, 5. Dog, 6. Iguana.)"
200	"这位法师如同卡通中的橡胶人般“弹跳”。武器从他们身上弹开，他们能通过“炮弹式”砸向地面将自己射向高空。坠落对他们来说从不构成伤害。他们甚至能通过弹跳自身对敌人发动攻击，造成严重伤害。 The Wizard “bounces” as if they are made of rubber in a cartoon. Weapons bounce off of them, they can shoot themselves high into the sky by “cannon balling” at the ground. A fall can never hurt them. They can even attack and deal serious damage by bouncing themselves at an enemy."
