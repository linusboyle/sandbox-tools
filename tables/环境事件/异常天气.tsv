1d120	异常天气
1-20	异常炎热（约比平时高10度）。这种异常气温持续1d6天。有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。 Unseasonably hot (approx. 10º hotter). Period of unusual temperature lasts for 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double this time.
21-40	异常寒冷（比正常温度低约10度）。这种异常气温将持续1d6天。有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。 Unseasonably cold (approx. 10º colder). Period of unusual temperature lasts of 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double this time.
41-45	异常炎热（比正常温度高11-20度）。这种异常气温持续1d4天。有1/6的几率是由魔法引起的，另有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。根据季节的不同，天气可能热到冒险者（尤其是穿着重甲或从事剧烈活动的人）有脱水的风险。在这种情况下，每日所需的水量翻倍（参见第7页）。 Unseasonably hot (+11-20º). Period of unusual temperature lasts for 1d4 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance the heat is caused by magical means, and an additional 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double the normal duration. Depending on the season, it may be hot enough that adventurers (especially those wearing heavy armor or engaged in strenuous activity) run the risk of becoming dehydrated. In these cases double the amount of water needed per day (see p. 7).
46-50	异常寒冷（-11至-20度）。这种异常温度将持续1d4天。有1/6的几率寒冷是由魔法引起的，另有1/6的几率寒冷持续时间会翻倍。根据季节的不同，气温可能低到足以对暴露在户外的人构成严重威胁。 Unseasonably cold (–11-20º). Period of unusual temperature lasts for 1d4 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance the cold is caused by magical means, and an additional1 in 6 chance it lasts for double the normal duration. Depending on the season, the temperature may become cold enough to pose a significant risk to those caught in the elements.
51-55	无风（风平浪静）。持续1d24小时。有1/6的几率持续1d6+1天。除非在海上，或依赖风力进行其他活动，否则此天气无机械性影响。 No winds (becalmed). Lasts for 1d24 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance this lasts for 1d6+1 days. Unless at sea, or relying upon wind for other reasons, this has no mechanical effects.
56-60	强风。风速约为20+1d20英里/小时。强风持续1d12小时。有1/6的几率强风持续时间翻倍，还有1/6的几率强风带来天气变化（再次掷骰，参考表7、8等）。这些风被视为强风。关于风可能产生的机械效果，请参阅第43页。 Strong winds. Approx. 20+1d20 mph. The winds last for 1d12 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance the winds last for double the indicated duration, and a 1 in 6 chance that the winds bring a change in weather (roll again on Table 7, 8 etc.). These winds are considered strong winds. Refer to p. 43 for information on the mechanical effects wind may have.
61-63	强风。风速约为60+2d20英里/小时。大风持续1d8小时。有1/6的几率大风持续时间翻倍，且有1-3/6的几率大风带来天气变化（再次在表7、8等上掷骰）。风力强劲，足以将轻质、未固定的物体吹至空中，并吹倒脆弱或受损的树木/建筑。这些风被视为强风。有关风可能产生的机械效果，请参阅第43页。 Strong winds. Approx. 60+2d20 mph. The winds last for 1d8 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance the winds last for double the indicated duration, and a 1-3 in 6 chance that the winds bring a change in weather (roll again on Table 7, 8 etc.). The winds are strong enough that light, unsecured objects are blown through the air and weakened or damaged trees/structures are knocked down. These winds are considered gale force. Refer to p. 43 for information on the mechanical effects wind may have.
64-66	非雨即雹。冰雹大小为：➢ 1-3 小 ➢ 4-5 中 ➢ 6 大。若掷出此结果时未预报有雨，则（1-3）在1d24小时内将有一场反常的风暴，或（4-6）冰雹将在下次预报有雨时出现。 Instead of rain, the result is hail. The hail is: ➢ 1-3 small ➢ 4-5 medium ➢ 6 large If no rain is forecast when this result is rolled, there is a (1-3) freak storm within 1d24 hours, or (4-6) the hail merely occurs the next time rain is forecast.
67	区域天气模式发生剧烈变化。在晴天和多云条件下，降雨几率增加（1-3）或减少（4-6）1d6。这种天气变化将持续：➢ 1-2 一周 ➢ 3 一个月 ➢ 4 一年 ➢ 5 十年 ➢ 6 永久。如果天气变化持续一年或更长时间，该地区的农业产出将受到影响。每格农业产出将：➢ 1-4 每月减少0.5金币 ➢ 5-6 每月增加0.5金币。裁判掷骰结果为：5, 4, 4, 5。他一直在使用本文档中的表7和表8。掷骰结果表明，该地区的降雨几率减少，大约持续一年。现在，晴天时只有掷出20才会下雨，多云时掷出15-20才会下雨。然而，这似乎与当地作物状况相符，因为农业产出每月增加了0.5金币。在表11——天气区域掷骰时，增加1d4。此外，天气变化增加了该地区的不稳定性。在该地区内的所有领地在天气变化期间进行的所有士气掷骰（见第58页）都将受到-1的惩罚。 There is a drastic shift in regional weather patterns. Increase (1-3) or decrease (4-6) the chance of rain by 1d6 in both clear and cloudy conditions. This change in weather will last for: ➢ 1-2 a week ➢ 3 a month ➢ 4 a year ➢ 5 a decade ➢ 6 permanently If the change in weather lasts for a year or more the agricultural output of the region will be altered. The output per hex will be: ➢ 1-4 decreased by .5 gp per month ➢ 5-6 increased by .5 gp per month The Referee rolls the following: 5, 4, 4, 5. He has been using Tables 7 and 8 as given in this document. The results of the rolls indicate that the chance of rainfall in the area is decreased, for approximately a year. It will now only rain on a result of 20 when clear, and 15-20 when cloudy. This seems to agree with the local crops, however, as agricultural output increases by .5 gp per month. When rolling on Table 11 – Area of Weather add 1d4 to the roll. Additionally, the change in weather adds instability to the region. Any domains within the region have a –1 penalty applied to all morale rolls (see p. 58) made during the period of weather change.
68	下一次降水将带有随机的魔法特性。其效果如下：➢ 1 对植物生长有益，使来年产量翻倍（每格农业产出翻倍）。➢ 2 对植物生长有害，使来年产量减半（每格农业产出减半）。➢ 3 在所有表面留下一层粘液，持续1d4小时后蒸发。➢ 4 降落后立即蒸发，所有表面保持干燥。➢ 5 降下弱效圣水（1-3）或弱效邪水（4-6）。对所有通常受该物质影响的生物，其效果减半。➢ 6 使非魔法金属物品立即生锈，品质降低一级（金属护甲的AC增加1，金属武器的伤害减少1点，等等）。如果使用表11，从掷骰结果中减去1d6。 The next time precipitation falls it is imbued with random magical qualities. It is: ➢ 1 beneficial to the growth of plants, effectively doubling any yields for the upcoming year (double agricultural output per hex). ➢ 2 detrimental to the growth of plants, effectively halving any yields for the upcoming year (half agricultural output per hex). ➢ 3 leaves a slimy mucus on all surfaces, which lasts for 1d4 hours before evaporating. ➢ 4 evaporates instantly upon falling, leaving all surfaces dry. ➢ 5 rains a weak holy water (1-3) or unholy water (4-6). Treat the substance as half potency for all creatures normally affected by the given substance. ➢ 6 causes non-magical metallic items to rust instantly, reducing their quality by one (metal armor has its AC increased by one, metal weapons inflict one fewer point of damage, etc.). If using Table 11, subtract 1d6 from the roll.
69	在确定天气影响范围时，可选择以下两种方式之一：➢ 掷出1-3时，将结果增加5。➢ 掷出4-6时，将结果减少5。参见表11。此结果将在接下来的1d6天内持续生效。 When determining the area the weather covers, either: ➢ 1-3 increase the result by 5. ➢ 4-6 decrease the result by 5. See Table 11. Apply this result for the next 1d6 days.
70	夜空中出现彗星，仅夜间可见。彗星将持续显现1d6天，有1/6的几率其可见时间延长一倍。彗星的影响如下：➢ 1-3，仅为普通彗星。➢ 4，预示冲突与战争。所有能观测到彗星的领地与组织需自动进行一次摩擦检定（见第103页，1-3为内部摩擦，4-6为外部摩擦）。➢ 5，彗星可见期间，异常天气事件更易发生，掷骰结果为1-2或19-20时触发。➢ 6，加剧紧张与负面情绪。所有反应检定均承受-1减值，但仅限于彗星可见期间（白天或阴云密布的夜晚无效）。此彗星：➢ 1，为独特事件。➢ 2，每3d4个月出现一次。➢ 3-5，每1d10年出现一次。➢ 6-11，每10d10年出现一次。➢ 12，每1d10世纪出现一次。 Comet in the sky, visible only at night. The comet remains visible for 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it is visible for twice as long. The comet: ➢ 1-3 is just a comet. ➢ 4 augurs strife and war. Make an automatic Friction roll (see p. 103) for all domains and organizations that can see the comet (on a 1-3 roll for Internal Friction, on 4-6 roll for External Friction). 5 while visible, unusual weather events are more likely, occurring on a roll of 1-2 or 19-20. ➢ 6 increases tensions and negative emotions. All reaction rolls have a –1 penalty applied, but only while the comet is visible (not during the day or on overcast nights). This comet: ➢ 1 is a unique event. ➢ 2 appears in the sky every 3d4 months. ➢ 3-5 appears in the sky every 1d10 years. ➢ 6-11 appears in the sky every 10d10 years. ➢ 12 appears in the sky every 1d10 centuries.
71	天空中出现一颗彗星，日夜可见。彗星将持续可见1d6天。有1/6的几率它会持续可见两倍的时间。这颗彗星：  ➢ 1 仅仅是一颗彗星。  ➢ 2 是一个预兆，预示着一个显赫而古老的家族将终结，可能是由于暴力（1-2）、疾病（3-4）或意外（5-6）。  ➢ 3 预示一位重要人物的诞生，此人将在彗星可见期间出生。有1-3/6的几率此人的身份已被预言者预言。  ➢ 4 预示着一个被埋藏了数个世纪的强大邪恶力量将苏醒。随机确定苏醒的生物类型。  ➢ 5 投掷1d6。结果为1-4时，所有伤害掷骰——无论是PC还是NPC——获得+1加值。结果为5-6时，伤害掷骰受到-1减值。这些加值或减值在彗星可见期间持续有效。注意，如果彗星不可见，例如被云层遮挡或冒险者在地下，则此效果无效。只有在暴力行为被彗星光芒照耀时才会生效。  ➢ 6 彗星在天空期间，魔法行为变得不可预测。每次奥术施法者施法时，有1d6%的几率发生以下情况（投掷1d4）：1：法术目标随机选择，2：法术持续时间加倍（1-3）或减半（4-6），3：法术范围加倍（1-3）或减半（4-6），或4：法术效果如同施法者等级提高1d4级（1-3）或降低1d4级（4-6）。  这颗彗星：  ➢ 1 是独一无二的事件  ➢ 2 每3d4个月出现在天空一次。  ➢ 3-5 每1d10年出现在天空一次。  ➢ 6-11 每10d10年出现在天空一次。  ➢ 12 每1d10个世纪出现在天空一次。 Comet in the sky, visible day and night. The comet remains visible for 1d6 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance it is visible for twice as long. The comet: ➢ 1 is just a comet. ➢ 2 is an omen that a prominent and ancient family line will end, either by violence (1-2), disease (3- 4), or mishap (5-6). ➢ 3 foretells the birth of an important individual, which will happen while the comet is visible. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance the identity of the person will have been foretold by oracles. ➢ 4 presages the waking of a potent evil, buried for centuries. Randomly determine the type of creature that awakens. ➢ 5 roll 1d6. On a result of 1-4, all damage rolls made – by PC and NPC alike – gain a +1 bonus. On a result of 5-6, damage rolls suffer a –1 penalty. These modifiers last for as long as the comet is visible. Note that if the comet is not visible, either because it is hidden by clouds or the adventurers are underground, for instance, this has no effect. It only occurs when acts of violence are bathed in the comet’s light. ➢ 6 Magic acts in an unpredictable manner while the comet is in the sky. Every time an arcane spellcaster casts a spell there is a 1d6% chance that (roll 1d4) 1: the target of the spell is chosen at random, 2: the duration of the spell is either doubled (1-3) or halved (4-6), 3: the range of the spell is either doubled (1-3) or halved (4-6), or 4: the spell functions as if the mage is either 1d4 levels higher (1-3) or 1d4 levels lower (4-6). This comet: ➢ 1 is a unique event ➢ 2 appears in the sky every 3d4 months. ➢ 3-5 appears in the sky every 1d10 years. ➢ 6-11 appears in the sky every 10d10 years. ➢ 12 appears in the sky every 1d10 centuries.
72	夜空中一颗星辰消失（1-3）或出现（4-6）。这：  ➢ 1 预示着凡间一股强大的秩序（1-3）或混沌（4-6）力量的消亡或诞生。  ➢ 2 标志着一位新神祇的陨落（1-3）或诞生（4-6）。  ➢ 3 若星辰消失，则削弱位面之间的界限；若新星出现，则加强界限。若加强，任何涉及召唤生物或位面旅行的法术有1/6的几率失败；若削弱，所有随机遭遇表中增加一个异界生物的结果，且在此期间召唤的生物每生命骰增加1点生命值。  ➢ 4 莫名影响对不死生物的驱散。若星辰消失，所有驱散尝试受到-1惩罚；若星辰出现，则获得+1加值。  ➢ 5 预示着某类怪物（如不死生物、狼人、龙等）活动减少（若星辰消失）或增加（若星辰出现）。裁判应根据此调整战役世界和游戏玩法。  ➢ 6 是自然现象，无特殊意义。  此天象持续：  ➢ 1-2 1d6天。  ➢ 3-4 1d6周。  ➢ 5-6 1d12月。  ➢ 7 1d10年。  ➢ 8 永久。 A star either disappears (1-3) or appears (4-6) in the night sky. This: ➢ 1 signifies the death/birth of a great force for Law (1-3) or Chaos (4-6) on the mortal plane. ➢ 2 marks the death (1-3) or birth (4-6) of a new deity. ➢ 3 weakens (if the star disappears) or strengthens (if a new one appears) the boundaries between the planes. If strengthened, any spell involving the summoning of creatures or travel between the planes now has a 1 in 6 chance of failure; if weakened, add an extra result for extraplanar creatures to all random encounter tables, and creatures summoned during this time gain 1 hp per HD. ➢ 4 inexplicably affects the turning of undead. If a star disappears, apply a –1 penalty to all turn attempts; if a star appears, apply a +1 bonus. ➢ 5 signifies the onset of a period of either the reduction (if the star vanishes) or increase (if a star appears) in the activities of a specific type of monster (such as undead, lycanthropes, dragons, etc). The Referee should interpret how this affects the campaign world and gameplay. ➢ 6 is a natural occurrence and means nothing. The stellar occurrence lasts: ➢ 1-2 1d6 days. ➢ 3-4 1d6 weeks. ➢ 5-6 1d12 months. ➢ 7 1d10 years. ➢ 8 permanently.
73	流星雨。夜晚可见（1-5）或白天也可见（6）。流星雨持续1d4天，有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。流星雨：➢ 1 导致近期（过去一年内）的死者从坟墓中复活，以僵尸形态攻击生者，被僵尸杀死的人将在1d4小时后复活。➢ 2 带来一种奇怪的太空瘟疫，感染区域由表11决定。在表3上掷骰，每列结果加10。➢ 3 降下火焰之雨，区域内所有物体受到3d6点伤害，有1-4/6的几率流星引发野火。流星雨使受影响区域的经济产出减少1d6×5%，持续1d4个月。➢ 4 实际上是太空怪物，裹着石茧坠落地球。有1-2/6的几率它们和平到来。➢ 5-6 含有极其珍贵的矿石，每回收8盎司价值1d4×100金币。星铁可用作制造魔法物品的主要或特殊材料。随机确定星铁用于武器时赋予的属性。例如，在阿布萨隆，星铁——源自太空虚空——对元素生物有强大效果。这次流星雨：➢ 1-3 是独特事件。➢ 4 每3d4个月在天空中出现一次。➢ 5-6 每1d10年在天空中出现一次。➢ 7-9 每10d10年在天空中出现一次。➢ 10-12 每1d10世纪在天空中出现一次。流星雨由1d100颗流星组成。每颗流星有1%的几率落地。每颗落地的流星重量为：➢ 1 1d8盎司。➢ 2-3 4d4盎司。➢ 4-5 1d4磅。➢ 6 2d20磅。 Meteor shower. Visible (1-5) at night or (6) during the day as well. The shower lasts for 1d4 days. There is a 1 in 6 chance of it lasting for twice the rolled duration. The shower: ➢ 1 causes the recently dead (within the past year) to rise from the grave and attack the living as zombies, and those killed by the zombies will in turn rise from the dead in 1d4 hours. ➢ 2 brings a strange space plague that infects an area determined by Table 11. Roll on Table 3, adding 10 to the results in each column. 3 rains fiery death down upon a region. Everything within the area of the strike takes 3d6 points of damage, and there is a 1-4 in 6 chance the meteors start wildfires. The meteor shower reduces economic output of the area affected by 1d6×5% for 1d4 months. ➢ 4 are actually space monsters, falling to earth in a cocoon of stone. There is a 1-2 in 6 chance they come in peace. ➢ 5-6 contains extremely valuable ore, worth 1d4×100 gold coins per 8 oz. recovered. The starmetal can be used as a principal or special component to create magical items. Randomly determine what properties starmetal imbues when used for weaponry. In Absalom, for instance, starmetal – born of the void of space – is potent against elementals. This shower: ➢ 1-3 is a unique event. ➢ 4 appears in the sky every 3d4 months. ➢ 5-6 appears in the sky every 1d10 years. ➢ 7-9 appears in the sky every 10d10 years. ➢ 10-12 appears in the sky every 1d10 centuries. The meteor shower is composed of 1d100 meteors. Each meteor has a 1% chance of reaching the ground. Each meteor that reaches the ground weighs ➢ 1 1d8 oz. ➢ 2-3 4d4 oz. ➢ 4-5 1d4 pounds. ➢ 6 2d20 pounds.
74	流星雨。这只是一场普通的流星雨，尽管它带来了盈利的机会。流星雨由1d100颗流星组成；每颗流星有1%的几率落在地面上。每颗落地的流星重量为：➢ 1 1d8盎司 ➢ 2-3 4d4盎司 ➢ 4-5 1d4磅 ➢ 6 2d20磅。每回收8盎司的流星，价值为1d4×100金币。关于星铁的用途，请参见上文（#73）。 Meteor shower. This is just a mundane meteor shower, albeit one presenting an opportunity for profit. It is composed of 1d100 shooting stars; each meteor has a flat 1% chance of landing on the ground. Each meteor that reaches the ground weighs ➢ 1 1d8 oz. ➢ 2-3 4d4 oz. ➢ 4-5 1d4 pounds. ➢ 6 2d20 pounds. Every 8 ounces recovered are worth 1d4×100 gp. See above (#73) for the uses of starmetal.
75	森林/野火。若无人尝试扑灭，火势将持续燃烧1d6天。每天火势将摧毁3d10平方英里的区域。每天的小雨有25%的几率扑灭火势，中雨每四小时有25%的几率扑灭火势，而大雨每小时有25%的几率扑灭火势。 Forest/wildfire. The fire will burn for 1d6 days if no attempt is made to stop it. For each day it burns the fire will destroy 3d10 square miles. Light rain has a 25% chance of extinguishing the fire per day of rain, moderate rain has a 25% chance per four hours of rain, and heavy rain has a 25% chance per hour.
76	天空在1d12小时内变为一种异常颜色。有1/6的几率这种变化会持续双倍时间。  ➢ 1-2：这种颜色对所有观察者预示不祥。在此期间，任何掷出的自然20变为自然1。  ➢ 3-4：导致野生动物大规模混乱。动物失去对人的恐惧并试图逃离，在此期间更容易被猎杀。  ➢ 5-6：在此期间出生的婴儿会带有与天空颜色相似的印记：他们的眼睛、头发或胎记会呈现出相同的奇异颜色。 The sky turns an unusual color for 1d12 hours. There is a 1 in 6 chance this change lasts for double the given duration. This ➢ 1-2 augurs ill for all who can observe the color. Any rolls of natural 20 made during this effect become natural 1s. ➢ 3-4 causes mass confusion among wildlife. Animals lose their fear of Man and try to flee, becoming easier to hunt during this period. ➢ 5-6 babies born during this time bear marks that resemble the changed color: their eyes, hair, or birthmarks are of the same strange color.
77	日偏食。太阳被部分遮蔽，持续时间为1d20分钟。有1/6的几率日食持续时间延长至原时长的两倍。在此期间：➢ 1 世界间的屏障减弱。召唤类法术的效果提升至平常的两倍。➢ 2 亡灵变得更加强大。所有亡灵，无论是否能看到日食，在此期间额外获得一个生命骰。➢ 3 无法施展四级及以上的牧师法术。➢ 4 魔法要么增强（1-3），要么受阻（4-6），所有奥术施法者在日食期间施法时，视其施法等级提高或降低一级。➢ 5-6 这只是一次日食。尽量不要直视它。在确定受影响区域时，表11的掷骰结果将受到-5的惩罚。 Solar eclipse (partial). The sun is partially obscured for a period of 1d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance the eclipse lasts for twice as long as the indicated duration. During this time ➢ 1 barriers between the worlds are lessened. Summoning spells function at twice their normal efficacy. ➢ 2 undead grow more powerful. All undead, regardless of whether they can see the eclipse or not, gain an extra hit die during this period. ➢ 3 no clerical spells of fourth level or higher may be cast. ➢ 4 magic is either enhanced (1-3) or hampered (4- 6), with all arcane spellcasters casting spells as if they were one level higher or lower while the sun is eclipsed. ➢ 5-6 it is just a solar eclipse. Try not to stare directly at it. There is a –5 penalty to the roll on Table 11 when determining the area affected.
78	日全食。太阳完全被遮蔽，持续1d20分钟。有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。在此期间：1. 非魔法火焰摇曳并熄灭。日食结束后，有1-3/6的几率它们自行重新点燃。2. 世界之间的屏障完全崩溃。召唤法术的效果提升至四倍，且1d10–1个不受控制的异界生物进入这个世界。3. 亡灵可以自由行走。任何被束缚在日食影响区域内特定地点的亡灵在日食期间可以自由移动，但日食结束后必须迅速返回巢穴。此外，所有亡灵获得额外的2个生命骰。4. 所有豁免检定获得+1加值（1-3）或-1减值（4-6）。5-6. 这只是一次日食。在确定影响区域时，使用表11进行掷骰时应用-5减值。 Solar eclipse (total). The sun is totally obscured for a period of 1d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for twice as long as the given duration. During this time ➢ 1 non-magical fires sputter and go out. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance that they re-light by themselves once the eclipse ends. ➢ 2 the barriers between worlds totally collapse. Summoning spells function at four times their normal efficacy, and 1d10–1 uncontrolled extraplanar creatures manage to enter the world. ➢ 3 the undead are free to walk abroad. Any undeadbound to a specific area within the effect of the eclipse are free to move about during the eclipse, but must swiftly return to their lairs once it is over. In addition, all undead gain an additional 2 hit dice. ➢ 4 all saving throws either gain a +1 bonus (1-3) or a –1 penalty (4-6). ➢ 5-6 it is just a solar eclipse. Apply a –5 penalty when rolling on Table 11 to determine the area of effect.
79	月食。月食仅在满月时发生，通常可以在相当广大的区域（或许整个大陆）观察到。若使用表11，掷骰结果加3。月食持续4d20分钟。若裁判已设定月历，则假定此结果出现在下一个满月时。若未设定，则假定月食发生在掷出此结果的当天；后续满月可由此结果推算得出。与日食不同，当地球完全遮蔽太阳时，月亮仅呈现红至棕色调，常被称为血月。在月食发生当天的24小时内：➢ 1 伤口无法愈合。月食期间所受的任何伤害无法通过自然方式愈合，必须借助魔法或特制药膏才能促进愈合。➢ 2 狼人活动尤为显著。在相应的遭遇表中增加或提高遭遇狼人的几率。在血月期间，狼人获得额外的生命骰，被咬后感染疾病的风险加倍。➢ 3 这是与灵体沟通的时机。任何允许提问或咨询灵体或异界存在的法术或能力，将额外获得一个问题（1-3）或提高获得正确答案的几率（4-6）。➢ 4-6 这只是一次普通的月食。 Lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses occur only during the full moon and can typically be seen over a fairly large area (an entire continent, perhaps). If using Table 11, add 3 to the roll. The eclipse lasts for 4d20 minutes. If the Referee has already established a lunar calendar, assume this result occurs during the next full moon. If not, assume the lunar eclipse happens on the day this result is rolled; further full moons can be extrapolated from this result. Unlike solar eclipses, when the earth fully obscures the sun, the moon merely takes on a red to brown tint and is often referred to as a blood moon. During the full 24 hours on the day a lunar eclipse occurs: ➢ 1 wounds do not heal. Any damage taken during the eclipse will not heal by natural means. Either magic or specially prepared poultices must be used to facilitate healing. ➢ 2 lycanthropic activity is especially pronounced. Add or increase the chances of encountering lycanthropes on the appropriate encounter tables. In the period during the blood moon, lycanthropes gain an additional hit die, and the risk of contracting the disease is doubled if bitten. ➢ 3 it is a time for communing with spirits. Any spell or ability that allows one to ask questions or consult spirit or extraplanar beings grants an additional question (1-3) or an increased chance of getting correct answers (4-6). ➢ 4-6 it is just a lunar eclipse.
80	地震。在确定受影响区域时，对表11应用-7的修正值。掷1d12以确定地震的严重程度：  ➢ 1-3 轻微震动。地面轻微摇晃，但不足以将墙上的画震落。  ➢ 4-6 小震。地面摇晃的力度足以使架子上的盘子震动，并将挂得不牢的画震落。建筑物不会受损，除非它们结构不佳。  ➢ 7-8 强烈震动。物体可能会掉落，建筑物受到轻微损坏（1d3点结构损伤*）。在地震震中，可能会打开一个小裂缝。  ➢ 9-10 重大震动。物体从架子上掉落，建筑物受到结构损伤*（1d6点）。在地震震中可能会打开一个大裂缝。站立的冒险者必须进行敏捷检定，掷3d6以避免被震倒。  ➢ 11 严重震动。建筑物遭受显著的结构损伤*（3d6点）。在人口密集地区有1-3/6的几率引发火灾。站立的冒险者必须进行敏捷检定，掷4d6以避免被震倒。小溪和小河的流向可能会改变，震中附近可能会打开一个大裂缝。  ➢ 12 百年一遇的地震。建筑物遭受巨大破坏（6d6点结构损伤*）。在人口密集地区有1-4/6的几率引发火灾。有1-3/6的几率使主要河流改道1d6英里。站立的冒险者必须进行敏捷检定，掷5d6以避免被震倒。  *参见第66页的结构考虑，了解结构生命值。  地震持续1d12轮，并产生以下效果：  ➢ 1-2 除了地震本身外，无其他影响。  ➢ 3 释放某种古老的邪恶或被囚禁的怪物。  ➢ 4 揭示一座长期失落的陵墓或遗迹。  ➢ 5 揭示一个通往土元素位面的传送门。有1-3/6的几率传送门不是永久性的，并在地震后2d10小时关闭。  ➢ 6 发现一条以前未被发现的珍贵矿石或矿脉，能够产出价值1d100 × 1000金币的矿石。  该地区的基础设施（如道路、水坝、桥梁）受到的损害等于1d12 × 100金币 × 地震的严重程度，而城市中心受到的损害等于1d20 × 100金币 × 市场等级 × 地震的严重程度，具体如下：  ➢ 轻微和正常震动不会对基础设施造成损害。  ➢ 强烈震动的金币损害倍数为1。  ➢ 重大震动的金币损害倍数为1.25。  ➢ 严重震动的金币损害倍数为1.5。  ➢ 百年一遇的震动的金币损害倍数为2。  有关基础设施的更多信息，请参阅领地建设章节。如果选择了具体的投资，请根据最合理的方式分配损害，或随机掷骰分配损害。如果使用抽象的投资成本，只需从总投资金额中扣除损害。 Earthquake. Apply a –7 modifier to Table 11 when determining the area affected. Roll 1d12 to determine the severity of the quake: ➢ 1-3 mild tremors. The ground shakes slightly, but not quite strongly enough to knock paintings off of walls. ➢ 4-6 minor tremors. The ground shakes with enough force to rattle plates on shelves and knock poorly hung paintings off walls. No damage to buildings, unless they’re poorly built. ➢ 7-8 strong tremors. Objects will likely fall, buildings sustain minor damage (1d3 points of structural damage*). At the epicenter of the quake, a small rift in the earth may open. ➢ 9-10 Major tremors. Objects are knocked from shelves, buildings take structural damage* (1d6 points). A large rift in the earth may open up at the epicenter of the quake. Standing adventurers must make a Dexterity check rolling 3d6 to avoid being knocked off their feet. ➢ 11. Severe tremor. Buildings suffer significant structural damage* (3d6 points). There is a 1-3 in 6 chance of fires starting in densely inhabited areas. Standing adventurers must make a Dexterity check rolling 4d6 to avoid being knocked off their feet. Streams and small rivers may have their courses shifted, and a large rift may open near the epicenter. ➢ 12. Once-in-a-lifetime quake. Buildings suffer massive damage (6d6 points of structural damage*). There is a 1-4 in 6 chance of fires starting in densely inhabited areas. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance that major rivers shift course by 1d6 miles. Standing adventurers must make a Dexterity check rolling 5d6 to avoid being knocked over. *See Structural Considerations, p. 66, for structural hit points. The earthquake lasts for 1d12 rounds and does the following: ➢ 1-2 nothing outside of being an earthquake. ➢ 3 releases some ancient evil or imprisoned monster. ➢ 4 reveals a long-lost tomb or ruin. ➢ 5 reveals a portal to the Elemental Plane of Earth. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance the portal is not permanent and will close 2d10 hours after the quake. ➢ 6 uncovers a previously undiscovered vein of valuable ore or minerals, capable of producing 1d100 × 1000 gold coins worth of ore. Infrastructure in the area (such as roads, dams, bridges) suffers damage equal to 1d12 × 100 gp × the severity of the quake, while urban centers take damage equal to 1d20 × 100 gp × Market Class × the severity of the quake as follows: ➢ Mild and normal tremors do no damage toinfrastructure. ➢ Strong tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 1. ➢ Major tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 1.25. ➢ Severe tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 1.5. ➢ Once-in-a-lifetime tremors have a gp damage multiplier of 2. Refer to the chapter on Domain Building for more information on infrastructure. If specific investments have been chosen assign damage as makes the most sense or roll to randomly assign damage. If using abstract investment costs simply subtract the damage from the total investment amount.
81	盛行风向在1d24小时内发生变化，带来：➢ 1 茉莉或其他异域香料的芬芳。➢ 2 海洋的气息，即便附近并无海洋。➢ 3 屠宰场般的血腥恶臭。➢ 4 如同火灾后的薄薄一层灰烬。➢ 5 低语呢喃，说着无人知晓的语言。➢ 6-8 无任何异常。若使用表11，则从掷骰结果中减去5。 The prevailing winds shift direction for 1d24 hours, bringing: ➢ 1 a smell of jasmine or other exotic spice. ➢ 2 the smell of the ocean, even if there is not one nearby. ➢ 3 the charnel smell of a slaughter-house. ➢ 4 a light dusting of ash, as if from a fire. ➢ 5 whispering voices, speaking in unknown tongues. ➢ 6-8 nothing. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
82	一场奇异的雨，天空却不见云彩。这场“雨”由以下成分组成：➢ 1 青蛙。➢ 2 蛇。➢ 3 蝗虫。➢ 4 血。➢ 5 鱼。➢ 6 花。若使用表11，则从掷骰结果中减去10。在表9上掷骰以确定“雨”的持续时间或强度。在猛烈的“雨”中，未受保护者可能会受到伤害或其他阻碍。 An unusual rain, with no clouds in sight. The “rain” consists of: ➢ 1 frogs. ➢ 2 snakes. ➢ 3 locusts. ➢ 4 blood. ➢ 5 fish. ➢ 6 flowers. If using Table 11, subtract 10 from the roll. Roll on Table 9 to determine the length/severity of the “rain”. In heavy “rains” those unprotected may suffer damage or other impediments.
83	暴雨倾盆而下，持续3d4分钟，每分钟降雨量达四分之一英寸。在峡谷、溪床和低洼地区，山洪暴发的危险极大。若使用表11，则从掷骰结果中减去5。 Heavy rains inundate the area, lasting 3d4 minutes and dropping a quarter inch of rain per minute. Flash floods are a danger in ravines, creek beds, and low-lying areas. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
84	强风席卷该地区，形成小型尘卷风。有1/6的几率这些尘卷风实际上是小型风元素。如果使用表11，掷骰结果需减去10。强风持续3d20分钟。有1/6的几率尘卷风的持续时间会翻倍。 Strong winds whip through the region, creating miniature dust devils. There is a 1 in 6 chance that dust devils are actually small air elementals. If using Table 11, subtract 10 from the roll. The strong winds last for 3d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance the dust devils last for double the indicated duration.
85	局部天气系统生成龙卷风。风暴持续4d20分钟，有1/6的几率龙卷风持续时间翻倍。风暴生成1d12个龙卷风，有1/6的几率生成数量翻倍。若使用表11，从掷骰结果中减去7。龙卷风效果如下：➢ 1-3为普通龙卷风。➢ 4实际上是狂暴的气元素，它们会攻击遇到的所有生物。➢ 5隐藏着通往另一个位面的传送门，有1-4/6的几率传送门通向气元素位面。被吸入龙卷风的人会立即被传送到那里，传送门在龙卷风结束时消失。➢ 6不会造成物理伤害，但会吸走该区域的所有颜色，有1/6的几率此效果永久持续，否则颜色会在1d12小时后恢复。 The localized weather system spawns tornadoes. The storm lasts for 4d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance the tornadoes last for double the indicated duration. The storm spawns 1d12 tornadoes, with a 1 in 6 chance that twice as many are created. If using Table 11, subtract 7 from the roll. The tornadoes ➢ 1-3 are just tornadoes. ➢ 4 are in fact rampaging air elementals, who will attack all living creatures they come across. ➢ 5 conceal a portal to another plane. There is a 1-4 in 6 chance the portal leads to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those sucked into the tornado are immediately transported there. The portal disappears when the tornadoes end. ➢ 6 cause no physical damage, but instead suck up all the color from the region. There is a 1 in 6 chance this effect is permanent, otherwise color returns in 1d12 hours.
86	云朵形成了可辨认的形状，持续时间为：➢ 1-2 几分钟。➢ 3-4 几个小时。➢ 5-6 一整天。这些形状：➢ 1 类似于特定的人物或生物。➢ 2 历史场景。➢ 3 未来可能发生的事件。➢ 4 已知语言中的文字或符文。➢ 5 未知语言中的文字或符文。➢ 6 玩家角色自己。 The clouds form recognizable shapes that last for ➢ 1-2 a few minutes. ➢ 3-4 a few hours. ➢ 5-6 all day. The shapes ➢ 1 resemble specific individuals or creatures. ➢ 2 scenes from history. ➢ 3 events that may occur in the future. ➢ 4 words or runes in a known language. ➢ 5 words or runes in an unknown language. ➢ 6 the PCs themselves.
87	云朵呈现出异常的颜色。这种颜色会持续：➢ 1-2 几分钟。➢ 3-4 几小时。➢ 5-6 一整天。 The clouds are an unusual color. They retain this color for: ➢ 1-2 a few minutes. ➢ 3-4 a few hours. ➢ 5-6 all day.
88	云端之上清晰可见一座城市。这座城市：➢ 1-2 有人居住。➢ 3-4 已被遗弃（注意，此结果意味着它已被建造者遗弃。云中之城可能仍有怪物栖息）。➢ 5-6 是幻象。这座城市：➢ 1-2 由云物质构成。➢ 3-4 由石头和泥土建造。➢ 5-6 由魔法本身编织而成。城市居民为：➢ 1 云巨人。➢ 2 有翼鸟人。➢ 3 一个誓不接触实地的种族。➢ 4-6 随机确定的生物类型，无论其是否具备飞行能力。有1/6的几率，这座城市仅持续1d6天后便会消失。 A city can plainly be seen atop a cloud. This city is: ➢ 1-2 inhabited. ➢ 3-4 abandoned (note that this result implies it has been abandoned by its builders. The cloud city may yet be inhabited by monsters). ➢ 5-6 an illusion. The city is:➢ 1-2 composed of cloud-stuff. ➢ 3-4 made of stone and earth. ➢ 5-6 spun from magic itself. The city will be inhabited by ➢ 1 cloud giants. ➢ 2 winged bird-men. ➢ 3 a race of men that has sworn never to touch solid ground. ➢ 4-6 a randomly determined type of creature, regardless of their ability to fly. There is a 1 in 6 chance the city will last for only 1d6 days before disappearing.
89	异常天象。若使用表11，则应用-3惩罚。接下来的1d6天内，将发生违背自然法则的奇异事件。这些事件有1/6的几率持续时间为原指示的两倍。具体表现为：➢ 1-3 一种异常现象。➢ 4-5 两种异常现象，每种持续时间相近。➢ 6 三种异常现象，每种持续时间相近。异常现象示例如下：1. 观察到鸟儿倒飞于天际。2. 捕食者与猎物的角色互换：羔羊猎杀狮子，蠕虫追逐飞鸟。3. 雨滴向上飘落。4. 降雨时，雨滴呈现奇异色彩：1. 蓝色，2. 绿色，3. 红色，4. 橙色，5. 黑色，6. 灰色。有1/6的几率雨水会改变地貌颜色。5. 水无法沸腾。6. 火焰燃烧但不散发热量。7. 动物开始以人类的声音说话。8. 当预言者宰杀动物以观其内脏时，发现1-2 它没有内脏；3-4 内脏中有一则用通用语写的信息，明确指出预言应放置何处；或5-6 内脏中满是蠕动的蛆虫。9. 家畜产下畸形怪物。10. 未受教育的农民突然理解复杂的哲学论辩，并放下手头工作去辩论这些新思想。异常现象有1-3/6的几率预示着某种可怕的灾难（1-4）或吉祥的恩赐（5-6）。否则，仅仅是些古怪的事情发生。无论如何，所有受影响区域需立即进行一次内部摩擦检定。 Unnatural events. Apply a –3 penalty if using Table 11. For the next 1d6 days, strange things occur that violate the laws of nature. There is a 1 in 6 chance these events last for twice the indicated duration. There will be: ➢ 1-3 One type of occurrence. ➢ 4-5 Two types of occurrence, each with a similar duration. ➢ 6 Three types of occurrence, each with a similar duration. Sample unnatural events are as follows: 1. Birds are observed flying backwards through the skies. 2. The roles of prey and predator are reversed: the lamb hunts the lion, the worm the bird. 3. Rain can be seen falling up. 4. When rain falls it is strangely colored. 1. blue, 2. green, 3. red, 4. orange, 5. black, 6. gray. There is a 1 in 6 chance the rain will actually change the color of the landscape. 5. Water does not boil. 6. Fires burn but do not give off heat. 7. Animals begin speaking with human voices. 8. When oracles sacrifice an animal to read its entrails, they find 1-2 it has no innards; 3-4 a message, in the Common tongue, telling them exactly where to put their prophesies; or 5-6 writhing masses of maggots. 9. Domesticated animals birth unnatural, deformed monstrosities. 10. Uneducated peasants all of a sudden begin to grasp complicated philosophical arguments and leave their tasks to debate these new ideas. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance the unnatural events portend some terrible disaster (1-4) or propitious boon (5-6). Otherwise, some weird stuff just happens. Regardless, all areas affected immediately make an Internal Friction roll.
90	天空中显现出一道彩虹，却未见雨滴。彩虹的类型为：➢ 1-3 单层。➢ 4-5 双层。➢ 6 三层。彩虹持续1d20分钟。有1/6的概率持续时间翻倍，另有1/6的概率其条纹排列顺序与常规不同。此外：➢ 1-3 它只是一道彩虹。➢ 4 每五分钟有1/6的概率会有一位小妖精接近队伍，提出以指引其金罐的位置为条件，与冒险者们达成某种妖精交易。➢ 5 彩虹是一座通往异世界的桥梁，踏上它的人将被传送到那个领域。有1-2/6的概率桥梁有守卫。➢ 6 彩虹是众神降下的预兆，指引冒险者走向他们的命运。这可能是（1-3）他们真正寻求之物，或（4-6）他们尚未知晓的人、物品或地点。 A rainbow is visible in the sky without rain. The rainbow is: ➢ 1-3 a single. ➢ 4-5 a double. ➢ 6 a triple. The rainbow lasts for 1d20 minutes. There is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for twice the given duration, and another 1 in 6 chance its rainbow stripes are arranged in a different order than would normally be expected. In addition: ➢ 1-3 it’s just a rainbow. ➢ 4 there is a 1 in 6 chance every five minutes the rainbow is present that a leprechaun approaches the party, offering the adventurers directions to its pot of gold in exchange for some fey bargain. ➢ 5 the rainbow is a bridge to another world, and will transport any who step aboard to this other realm. There is a 1-2 in 6 chance the bridge is guarded. ➢ 6 the rainbow is an omen sent by the gods, to guide the adventurers to their destiny. This may be (1-3) something they actually seek or (4-6) a person, item, or place as yet unknown to them.
91	极光。夜空中出现奇异的光带，仿佛有生命般舞动。极光通常持续3d20分钟，但有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。通常，极光只能在赤道以北或以南的极地地区看到，但在奇幻世界中未必如此。极光➢1是一个有意识的生物，可能是一个元素生物。➢2发出几乎听不见的音乐。➢3作为通往其他世界的门户。必须能够飞入闪烁的光芒中才能通过这种方式旅行。➢4使得在其光芒下施放的所有法术的变量效果都达到最大值。➢5-6仅仅是天空中美丽的光影。 Aurora. Strange bands of light appear in the night sky, dancing as if alive. The aurora typically lasts for 3d20 minutes, although there is a 1 in 6 chance it lasts for double the indicated duration. Typically, the aurora is only seen far north or south of the equator, although this need not be the case in a fantasy world. The aurora ➢ 1 is a sentient creature, possibly an elemental. ➢ 2 produces barely audible music. ➢ 3 acts as a gateway to other worlds. One must be able to fly into the shimmering lights in order to travel by these means. ➢ 4 causes all spells cast under its light to have all their variable effects occur at their maximum limits. ➢ 5-6 is just pretty lights in the sky.
92	尸火（“圣艾尔摩之火”）。这种奇特的静电现象通常无害，往往会在尖状物体上聚集，如桅杆、船首、塔尖等，但也有报道称人的手指和鼻子会被这种奇异闪烁的光芒勾勒出来。若使用表11，则从掷骰结果中减去10。这种现象持续1d20小时，且有1/6的几率持续时间为原定时间的两倍。这种奇异天气现象多伴随降水或雾气出现，因此裁判官可能希望等到下次下雨或下雪时再应用此效果。除了惊吓无知和迷信者外，尸火：➢ 1-4 仅是自然现象。➢ 5 实际上是一种有意识的生物，试图通过光的微妙闪烁进行交流。➢ 6 在火焰持续期间，增加遭遇不死生物的概率。在适用的遭遇表中添加1d4种不死生物类型。 Corpse-lights (“St. Elmo’s Fire”). Typically, this strange form of static lightning is harmless. It tendsto coalesce on pointed objects, such as masts, prows, spires of towers, etc., although there are reports of people’s fingers and noses being outlined in this strange, flickering light. If using Table 11, subtract 10 from the roll. It lasts for 1d20 hours, with a 1 in 6 chance of lasting double the given duration. This strange weather event most often occurs with precipitation – or foggy conditions – so the Referee might want to wait and apply it the next time there is rain/snow. In addition to spooking the ignorant and superstitious, the corpse-light: ➢ 1-4 is simply a natural phenomenon. ➢ 5 is actually a sentient being, attempting to communicate in a language based on the subtle flickering of light. ➢ 6 increases the chance of encounters with undead whilst the fire lasts. Add 1d4 types of undead to the applicable encounter tables.
93	浓雾笼罩大地。这场雾将持续1d20小时，且有1/6的几率持续时间为原指示的两倍。任何试图在雾中行进的人都有迷路的风险，具体规则由裁判根据荒野导航规则决定。在雾中迷路的几率翻倍。雾的效果如下：➢ 1-2：仅为普通雾气，视野减少四分之三。➢ 3：雾中含有非本地区域的怪物。➢ 4：雾气半固态，移动速度减半。➢ 5：雾气通向另一个世界或位面。任何在雾中迷路的人，每小时都有1/6的几率进入这个异世界。➢ 6：任何在雾中死亡的人类或半人类，除非在死后一小时内火化，否则会自动化为亡灵。若使用表11，则掷骰结果减去5。 A dense fog covers the land. The fog lasts for 1d20 hours and has a 1 in 6 chance of lasting twice as long as indicated. Any folk trying to navigate in the fog run the risk of becoming lost, based on whatever rules the Referee is using for navigating in the wilderness. Double the chances of getting lost while in the fog. The fog: ➢ 1-2 is just normal fog, reducing vision by three- quarters. ➢ 3 contains monsters not native to this region. ➢ 4 is semi-solid, reducing movement rates by half. ➢ 5 leads to another world or plane. Any persons becoming lost in the fog have a 1 in 6 chance of entering this other world for every hour spent wandering. ➢ 6 causes any humans or demi-humans that die within the fog to automatically rise as undead unless cremated within an hour of death. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
94	一片薄雾笼罩大地。雾气持续1d12小时，有1/6的几率持续时间翻倍。雾气效果如下：➢ 1-3 仅为普通雾气。➢ 4 雾中含有吸取生命的雾怪。➢ 5 雾气中弥漫着硫磺的气味。➢ 6 任何在雾中施法的角色必须通过一次法术豁免检定，才能成功施法。若使用表11，则从掷骰结果中减去5。 A thin mist covers the land. The mist lasts for 1d12 hours, with a 1 in 6 chance of lasting twice as long as indicated. The mist ➢ 1-3 is just normal mist. ➢ 4 contains life-draining mist monsters. ➢ 5 smells of sulfur. ➢ 6 forces those casting any sort of spell while physically within the mist to succeed on a Save v. Spells in order to actually do so. If using Table 11, subtract 5 from the roll.
95	球状闪电。真正的闪电球四处漂浮，造成的伤害与一道真正的闪电相当。一场典型的风暴会在指定区域内生成1d10个球状闪电。这些闪电球移动缓慢，每轮仅移动20英尺，但与普通闪电同样危险，尤其是因为它们可以与目标保持接触多个回合。球状闪电会被以下事物吸引：➢ 1 大量金属。➢ 2 高大的建筑物。➢ 3 强烈的魔法气息。➢ 4 混沌生物。➢ 5 秩序生物。➢ 6 无差别目标。如果使用表11，则从掷骰结果中减去10。 Ball lightning. Literal balls of lightning float about, doing as much damage as an actual bolt of lightning. A typical storm will generate 1d10 balls of lightning within the given area. These balls are slow, moving at only 20’ per round, but just as dangerous as normal lightning, especially since they can remain in contact with a target for multiple rounds. Ball lightning is attracted to: ➢ 1 large amounts of metal. ➢ 2 tall buildings. ➢ 3 strong magical dweomers. ➢ 4 creatures of Chaos. ➢ 5 creatures of Law. ➢ 6 indiscriminate targets. If using Table 11 subtract 10 from the roll.
96	延长天气系统。当天掷骰决定的天气将持续额外1d4天。 Extended weather system. The weather indicated by the day’s roll lasts an addition 1d4 days.
97	变幻莫测的天气。一天过半时，天气有可能突然转变。重新在表7上掷骰，以此类推。 Changeable weather. Halfway through the day, the weather has a chance of abruptly changing. Roll again on Table 7, etc.
98	魔法干旱（1-3）或魔法泛滥（4-6）。在1d24小时内，所有奥术（1-3）、神术（4-6）或两者兼有（7-8）的法术在施放时需通过一次对抗法术的豁免检定才能成功施放（干旱），或者施法者如同其等级提升了1d4级（每个法术随机决定）来施放（泛滥）。 Magical drought (1-3) or surfeit (4-6). For 1d24 hours, all arcane (1-3), divine (4-6) or both (7-8) spells require a successful Save v. Spells to cast successfully (drought), or are cast as if the caster were 1d4 (determine randomly for each spell) levels higher (surfeit).
99-100	这两个结果留空，供裁判自行填写自定义事件，或复制表格中其他事件以增加其发生概率。例如，在一个以地震活动闻名的地区，裁判可能希望将99和100都填写为额外地震事件（#80）。如有需要，裁判可在表10上掷骰以确定任何异常天气的确切原因。同样，裁判也可在表11上掷骰，以确定每种天气效果——无论是正常还是异常——所覆盖的区域。这在较高等级时可能特别有用，因为飞行、传送等方式使旅行速度加快。需要注意的是，表11中的某些结果仅可能通过掷骰获得，且需指定为异常事件。 These two results are left blank for the Referee to fill in with their own custom events, or to duplicate events from elsewhere on the table so as to increase their chances of occurrence. For instance, in an area known for seismic activity, they may wish to fill both 99 and 100 with additional earthquake (#80) entries. If desired, the Referee may roll on Table 10 to determine the exact cause of any unusual weather. If desired, the Referee can roll on Table 11 to determine the area each weather effect – whether normal or unusual – covers. This may be useful at higher levels when travel becomes faster due to flight, teleportation, etc. Note that some of the results on Table 11 are only possible by rolling for an Unusual Event that specifies it.
