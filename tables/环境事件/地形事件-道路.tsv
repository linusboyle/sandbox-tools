1d100	地形事件-道路
1	队伍遇到一位正在费力拉网的渔夫。若提供帮助，会发现网被一个覆盖着古老圣徽的生锈铁棺材卡住了。棺材感觉异常沉重。 The party comes across a fisherman struggling to pull his net up. If assisted, it turns out to have been stuck on a rusted iron coffin covered in old holy symbols. The coffin feels heavy.
2	队伍注意到一辆旅行马车周围的小径上有几座雕像。靠近后，他们发现其中一些雕像呈现出恐惧的表情和姿态。一只石化蜥蜴正在路边的灌木丛中享用其中一名受害者。由于它正忙于进食且已饱腹，队伍可以轻松绕过它，除非他们决定发动攻击。 The party notices several statues in the path around a traveling wagon. As they approach closer they notice some of the statues are in poses with expressions of fear. A basilisk is feasting on one of the victims in the bushes just off the path. Since it is preoccupied and full, the party can easily pass it unless they decide to attack it.
3	一位贵族及其随从正从一场极其失败的狩猎中归来。他提议，如果队伍能为他猎杀一头野兽带回展示给朋友，他将给予金币和食物作为报酬。 A noble and his entourage are returning from a very unsuccessful hunt. He propositions the party with gold and food if they can hunt a beast for him to take back and show his friends.
4	队伍遇到一辆马车，窗户中轻轻飘出烟雾。若调查，队伍会发现一位半身人烟斗商人正在吸食一种浓烈的烟叶。他会用一些烟叶换取玩家们的硬币。 The party comes across a wagon with smoke lightly flowing out of the windows. If investigated, the party will find a halfling pipe salesman smoking a strong strand of pipeweed. He will offer the players some of his pipeweed in exchange for coins.
5	"队伍遇到一群愤怒的人，他们正在将一堆树枝堆放在一个被绑在木桩上的老妇人脚下。他们高喊着“女巫”、“烧死她！”和“她是黑暗领主的仆人！”，并要求火把。 The party comes across a crowd of people with an angry disposition. They are placing stacks of branches around the feet of an old woman tied to a stake. They call for a torch amid cries of, ""Witch"", ""Burn her!"", and ""She's a servant of the dark lord!"""
6	队伍遇到一条清澈潺潺的小溪，有踏脚石可过，河岸良好，浅得足以让轻载的马车涉水而过，而且还有丰富的鱼类资源！附近的一位德鲁伊对任何怀着善意、轻步踏过这片土地的旅人都颇为友好。 The party comes across a clear babbling stream, stepping stone crossing, good banks, shallow enough to ford a lightly loaded wagon, and with good fishing too! A nearby druid is somewhat friendly with any travelers passing through with good intentions and a light step upon the land.
7	玩家们发现地上有一个洞，周围跪着鹿、狐狸和其他森林动物，似乎在祈祷。它们并非有智慧生物，但似乎戴着粗糙的王冠和其他装饰。洞中喷出白色烟雾，能引发幻觉。 The players come across a hole in the ground surrounded by deer, foxes and other forest animals kneeling in apparent prayer, they are not sentient but appear to be wearing crude crowns and other adornments. The hole spews a white smoke that causes hallucinations.
8	路边有一座供奉守序善良神祇的小神龛。神龛由一英尺厚的木墙构成，上方有小型屋顶，墙上凸出一尊神祇的木雕。墙上钉着几张写有祈祷文的羊皮纸碎片。神龛脚下摆放着各种供品：新鲜割下的谷物、鲜花、编织的手绳、一个男孩的木雕等。一个木碗里盛有2d6枚金币。 On the side of the road is a small shrine to a lawful good deity. The shrine is a one-foot-thick wooden wall with a small roof over it with a wooden carving of the deity protruding from the wall. A handful of scraps of parchment bearing prayers are tacked to the wall. Various offerings lie at the foot of the shrine: Fresh cut grain, flowers, a woven cord bracelet, a wooden carving of a boy, etc. A wooden bowl contains 2d6 gold pieces.
9	前方路边停着一辆装满萝卜的马车。一个驼背的农民正试图修理车轮上断裂的辐条。他请求队伍帮忙将修好的车轮装回马车。在帮助者成功通过力量检定后，农民作为感谢，向队伍提供了一些腌猪蹄，这些猪蹄算作优质口粮。 A horse and cart loaded with turnips is stopped on the side of the road up ahead. A hunched peasant farmer is attempting to fix one of the wheel’s broken spokes. He asks if the party can help him get the mended wheel back onto the cart. After a successful strength check from whoever helps him, the farmer offers the party some pickled pigs feet in thanks that count as good-quality rations.
10	队伍在路边发现一辆被掀翻并点燃的马车。拉车的马已被杀死，大部分肉被割走。马车夫的尸体在附近的灌木丛中被发现。如果队伍检查烧焦的马车内容物，会发现车上装载着许多幸运符包裹。大部分已被烧毁或熔化，但他们还是找到了3d10个完好无损的幸运符。 The party finds a cart on the side of the road that has been overturned and lit ablaze. The horse that was pulling the cart has been killed and much of its meat removed. The corpse of the cart driver can be found in the bushes nearby. If the party examines the contents of the charred cart they find it was carrying a number of bundles of lucky charms. Most of them have been burned or melted together, but they do manage to find 3d10 lucky charms that survived the fire intact.
11	偏离常道后，队伍来到一座显眼的山丘，山顶上有一块巨大的铁砧，似乎由构成山丘的石头制成。魔法从铁砧中散发出来，渗向任何靠近它的武器。 After falling off the beaten path, the party comes upon a prominent hill topped with a large anvil that appears to be made of the very stone that comprises the hill. Magic can be seen emanating from the anvil and seeping towards any weapon that is brought close to it.
12	一位老猎人向玩家们打招呼，邀请他们共享篝火午餐。他开始用滑稽的老人嗓音讲述过去的美好时光。午餐后，他继续滔滔不绝地讲着。玩家们需要巧妙地进行角色扮演，以免冒犯这位友善的老人，或者干脆不顾他的感受，直接离开。 An old hunter greets the players and offers to share his fire for lunch. He gets to talking about the good old days, and talks in a funny old man voice. After lunch, he keeps talking. And talking. And talking. The players have to get clever with roleplay to avoid offending the nice man, or just disregard his feelings and take off.
13	一只白鹿从你面前快速跑过。队伍中任何迷信的成员都会认为这是神明的征兆。你们的旅程将受到祝福！ A white hart crosses your path before quickly sprinting away. Any superstitious member of the party recognizes this as a sign from the Gods. Your trip is blessed!
14	队伍注意到一个小村庄外一英里处，一棵孤树的阴影下放着一个木桶。敏锐的眼睛会发现密封盖边缘有苍蝇嗡嗡飞舞；地面上明显有木桶被滚动或拖拽到这里的痕迹。如果队伍打开木桶，他们会发现一具年轻男子的浮肿尸体以不自然的姿势卡在里面。桶底还残留着约两到三英寸深的葡萄酒；年轻男子似乎穿着送货公司的制服。 The party notices a barrel sat in the shade of a lone tree a mile outside of a small village. Keen eyes spot flies buzzing about the edge of the sealed lid; the ground shows clear signs of the barrel having been rolled or dragged to this spot. If the party opens the barrel, they find the bloated corpse of a young man wedged in an unnatural pose inside. The bottom of the barrel still has about two to three inches of wine sat in it; and the young man appears to be dressed in the livery of a delivery company.
15	队伍遇到一条从主路岔出的小土路，路上飘来一股非常甜美、芬芳的香气。如果队伍跟随香气前行，他们将发现一片小野花田，这些花正是当地一种昂贵香水的原料。 The party comes across a small dirt path branching off the main road. A very sweet, fragrant scent is coming from this path. If the party follows it, they will come across a small field of flowers that are used in an expensive perfume in the region.
16	玩家们遇到一个陷入完全混乱的小村庄。一只因出生时带有神祇圣徽形状的胎记而被视为奇迹的小猪失踪了。整个村庄因贪婪和猜疑而四分五裂。 The players come across a small hamlet that is in complete turmoil. A piglet who was seen as a miracle because it was born with a birthmark in the shape of a deity's holy symbol has gone missing. The entire hamlet is torn apart by greed and suspicion.
17	一位旅行艺术家在附近田野支起画布，正在绘制野花。5铜币，他可为队伍在纸上作一幅炭笔画。5金币，他会停下花卉绘画，跟随队伍绘制一幅肖像直至完成。若询问其作品，他会兴奋地展示速写本，里面满是路上偶遇之人的各种素描与肖像。他自称过目不忘，甚至可根据队伍提供的细节，以10铜币绘制某人画像。 A traveling artist has set up a canvas in a nearby field and is painting some wildflowers. For 5 copper pieces, he will make a charcoal drawing on paper for the party. For 5 gold pieces, he will stop his flower painting and spend time following the party painting a portrait of the party until he is finished. If prompted about his work, he will get excited and show off his sketchbook. It's full of various drawings and portraits of people he's passed on the road. He says he never forgets a face and will even draw someone according to details given by the party for 10 copper pieces.
18	队伍遇到一伙伪装成宗教苦行者的强盗，他们正前往附近一座寺庙朝圣，计划抢劫圣地并杀害庙内所有人。 The party comes across a band of highwaymen posing as religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple. They plan to rob the holy site and kill everyone inside its walls.
19	一群占星家正从附近城市前往乡村，以观测一场预言中的流星雨。他们大约有二十多人，大多是业余占星家，身份为小贵族或中上阶层，但也有几位学者甚至一位法师。 A society of astrologists are traveling from a nearby city to a rural area to witness a meteor shower that has been predicted. There are two dozen of them or so. Most of them are amateur astrologists who are minor nobles or upper middle class, but there are a few scholars and even a wizard.
20	路旁传来咆哮与挣扎声，一只受伤的狮鹫（或双足飞龙）被困在偷猎者的陷阱中，左翼被一种带链的熊爪装置所伤。链条锁住并钉在树桩上，旁边躺着一具山羊尸体，可能是诱饵。这只生物非常警觉，若非被40英尺长的链条限制，会攻击任何看到的人形生物。解救她并不容易，因为她现在对周围的一切都充满不信任。一旦有人试图解开链条，灌木丛中便会射出箭矢，偷猎者回来夺取战利品，这使野兽再次变得敌对。 There is roaring and thrashing from somewhere off the road. A wounded griffon (or wyvern) is trapped in some poachers’ device and her left wing is damaged by some sort of bear claw device connected to a chain. The chain is locked and hammered into a tree stump, next to it lays the carcass of a goat that was probably used to lure her here. The creature is very wary and will attack any humanoid on sight if it weren’t for her chain radius of 40 ft. Freeing her is not easy as she distrusts everything around her now. This is reinforced the moment someone tries to remove the chain as arrows fly from the shrubbery and the poachers return for their trophy, this turns the beast hostile again.
21	队伍在路旁的小空地上发现了一只新近被杀的鹿。一群乌鸦正在啄食尸体。其中一只乌鸦比其他的大得多，几乎是它们的两倍。 The party comes across a freshly slain deer in a small clearing alongside the road. A pack of crows feed on the corpse. One of the crows is much larger than the others, nearly twice the size.
22	一位老妇人坐在路边一块平坦的大石头上，轻轻拨弄着膝上的扬琴。当队伍靠近时，她询问他们是否能给她三天的口粮和水，以便她能到达最近的城镇。如果他们愿意，她可以为队伍施展一个高级吟游诗人法术作为回报。 An old lady sits atop a large flat stone at the side of the road, strumming softly on a dulcimer sat upon her lap. As the party approaches, she asks them if they can spare her three days worth of rations and water in order for her to reach the nearest town. If they do, she can cast one high level bard spell for the party as payment.
23	一队旅行者和商人正被六名道路守卫搜查。附近的一辆马车上，一名商人显得坐立不安。他提出给队伍5金币以制造一场混乱。 A line of travelers and merchants are being searched by a half dozen road wardens. On a nearby cart, a merchant can be seen fidgeting nervously. He offers the party 5 gold pieces to cause a distraction.
24	队伍遇到一群杂技演员。他们正在路边的一棵大树上练习攀爬动作。如果被问及，他们正前往附近城市，为一位重要贵族举办的宴会表演。 The party comes across a group of acrobats. They are practicing one of their climbing routines on a tall tree off the side of the road. If asked, they are traveling to a nearby city to perform for a party hosted by an important noble.
25	玩家们在一棵树上发现了一张传单，内容是关于最近一支木精灵团伙对伐木定居点的袭击。伐木定居点正在招募人手驱逐这些精灵。 The players come across a flyer nailed to a tree regarding recent attacks on a logging settlement by a band of wood elves. The logging settlement is recruiting people to drive off the elves.
26	队伍偶然发现一个被遗忘、杂草丛生的村庄。初看之下，它似乎被匆忙遗弃；没有撤离或抵抗的迹象。在教堂内，村民们聚集在一起，几乎保持着生前的模样，化作了某种树皮形态，跪地祈祷的姿态被永久定格。 The party comes across a lost, overgrown village. At first it appears abandoned, and quickly abandoned at that; there is no sign of evacuation or resistance. Inside the church the townsfolk are gathered, appearing almost as they did in life, frozen in some sort of bark form in a kneeling prayer position.
27	路障由三名道路守卫把守。前方一英里处有个小镇感染了黄热病，已被隔离。道路守卫会解释一条迂回路线，只会让他们的旅程增加一天左右。 There is a roadblock manned by three road wardens. A mile up the road there is a small town infected with the yellow plague. It has been quarantined. The road wardens will explain a circuitous route that will only add a day or so to their travel.
28	一棵巨大的橡树耸立在十字路口上方。树上挤满了乌鸦，七具高大绿色兽人的尸体悬挂在树枝上。 A tremendously large oak tree looms over a crossroads. The tree is crowded with crows and the corpses of seven big green orcs hang from its branches.
29	队伍遇到一位女子，她正从一辆大车上兜售用过的魔法护符。她的助手，一位拉着大车的聋哑巨人，每当有人靠近时都会咧嘴笑。她以温柔细语的方式相当迷人。稍加打探后，发现他们曾是并肩冒险的朋友。 The party comes across a woman peddling used magical talismans out of a cart. Her assistant, a large deaf giant who is pulling said cart, grins whenever someone comes near. She's rather charming in a soft spoken way. A bit of prodding into the pair reveals they are both friends who once adventured together.
30	队伍在路边发现了一具矮人的尸体。矮人显然是被从背后刺伤并遭抢劫。他手中紧握着一本打开的小书，书中列有一串名字，大部分已被划掉。然而，最后一个名字是用矮人手指上的血写下的，显然是在他临终之际... The party comes across the corpse of a dwarf on the roadside. The dwarf was apparently stabbed in the back and robbed. In his hand, he clutches a small open book. The book contains a list of names and most of them have been crossed out. However, there is one last name written in blood by the dwarf’s finger, apparently in his dying moments...
31	队伍在远处发现了一些奇怪的山丘。通过智力检定可得知，它们是早已消亡部落的坟冢。或许那些坟墓中藏有财富？ The party spots some strange hills in the distance. An intelligence test will reveal that they are burial mounds from a long dead tribe. Perhaps there is wealth hidden in those tombs?
32	路边沟渠中发现一辆翻倒的马车。外观完好，但内部被撕碎，血迹斑斑。 An overturned carriage can be found in a ditch on the roadside. The exterior is intact, but the inside has been ripped apart, and is stained with blood.
33	一只乌鸦被看到跟随队伍中的某位成员。若该成员移动，乌鸦便跟随。若有人靠近，乌鸦会飞走。当晚，被跟随者将做噩梦。 A raven can be seen following a single member of the party. If they move one way, the raven follows. The raven will fly away if anyone gets close to it. That night, the one who was followed has horrible dreams.
34	一群当地人正在售卖一种由苹果和多种浆果制成的传统果酒，这种酒在本地很有名。他们从桶中倒酒，收取几枚银币来装满你的杯子或酒囊。 A group of locals are selling a traditional fruit wine made from apples and various berries that is famous in the region. They are pouring it from a barrel and are charging a few silver pieces to fill your cup or wineskin.
35	道路穿过一片开阔的田野，山顶上有一棵孤树作为显著地标。树干旁似乎倚靠着什么东西。如果调查，玩家会发现一把制作精良的+1双手剑。 The road cuts through an open field with a hill and a lone tree on top as a prominent landmark. There appears to be something leaning against the trunk. If investigated, the players will find a well-made +1 two-handed sword.
36	一位有点跛脚的老矮人牵着一头驮满各种杂物和小玩意儿的驴子。他会试图向玩家们兜售各种奇怪的物品。 An old dwarf with a bit of a limp is leading a donkey that is overladen with various junk and knick knacks. He will try to sell the players all sorts of strange items.
37	一位高阶圣武士正带着1d10名新信徒沿路行进，他们在离队伍营地不远处扎营。夜晚，其中一名新信徒悄悄来到队伍这边，询问关于冒险生活的各种问题。到了早晨，这名提问的新信徒却不知所踪。队伍可能会在地区的另一处再次遇见他。 A high ranking paladin is traveling down the road with 1d10 initiates. They make camp a short distance from the party's camp. During the night, one of the initiates sneaks over to the party and asks all manner of questions about the adventuring lifestyle. In the morning, the questioning initiate is nowhere to be found. The party may see him again in another part of the region.
38	一群来自邻国战争的难民在路上向你求助，他们急需食物和庇护。 A group of refugees from a neighboring war approach you on the road. They are desperate for food and shelter.
39	队伍遇到一个十字路口。在路的一角，一块破损的路标躺在杂草中。这块路标标明了每条路的去向，但他们不确定路标是否正确摆放。 The party comes across a crossroads. At one of the corners of the road, a broken sign lays in the weeds. This sign tells which direction each road leads, but they aren't certain on the correct orientation of the sign.
40	一位骑士和他的侍从正路过此地。这位英勇的骑士渴望证明自己，向你们中最强的战士发起决斗挑战。 A knight and his squire are passing on the road. He's a gallant Knight looking to prove himself and challenges your best fighter to a duel.
41	美妙的夜空中满是发光的飞蛾。它们在队伍上空盘旋，细小的尘埃从它们身上飘落，当它们飞走时，给每个人留下一种宁静的感觉。 The wonderful night sky is filled with glowing moths. They spin in the sky above the party, and small clouds of dust drift down from them, leaving everyone with a peaceful feeling as they flit away.
42	队伍在路边发现一棵大树，树上爬满了至少十几只巨型蜈蚣。树内有一条隧道，通向蜈蚣幼虫的巢穴。 The party finds a large tree off the side of the road covered in at least a dozen giant centipedes. Inside of the tree is a tunnel that leads down to a nursery of centipede larva.
43	远处，一座小塔矗立在地平线上。那是一座早已废弃的古老瞭望塔的遗迹。如果玩家爬到塔顶，可以一览周围地区的壮丽景色。 In the distance, a small tower stands over the horizon. It is the ruins of an old watch tower that has long since been abandoned. If the players climb to the top, they can get a great view of the surrounding area.
44	一队由一位令人生畏的队长带领的雇佣兵正沿路行进。他们正在搜寻据报在该地区扎营的一支大型兽人队伍。 A group of mercenaries, led by an intimidating captain, marches down the road. They are searching for a large orc party that is reported to be camping in the area.
45	队伍遇到了一位游荡的山丘巨人。他丢失了“幸运闪亮物”，急切想要找回。如果任何玩家穿着闪亮的重甲，山丘巨人会误以为他们偷走了“幸运闪亮物”盔甲，并试图夺回！ The party comes across a wandering hill giant. He has lost his 'lucky shiny' and is desperate to get it back. If any of the players are wearing heavy, shining armor, the hill giant will think THEY are the one who stole the 'lucky shiny' armor, and will try and get it back!
46	玩家的道路将他们引向一条汹涌的河流。这条河通常平静而缓慢流动，此刻却变成了猛烈的激流。它摧毁了玩家需要通过的桥梁。他们将如何继续旅程？ The player's path brings them to a raging river. The river, normally calm and slowly moving, is currently a fierce torrent. It has destroyed the bridge the players need to cross. How will they continue their journey?
47	当队伍走在茂密森林中的路上时，他们听到树枝发出巨大的嘎吱声。突然，一名随机队员被一只古老树人用手吊到空中。树人紧紧抓住玩家，说他们看起来和几个月前引发森林大火的人一模一样。 As the party is walking down a heavily forested part of the road, they hear the loud creaking of branches. All of a sudden, a random party member is hoisted into the air by the hand of an ancient treant. The treant, gripping the player tightly, says they look exactly like the one who started a forest fire a couple months back.
48	一辆载满囚犯的旅行监狱马车横穿队伍路径。队伍中一名成员认出其中一名囚犯是儿时好友。 A traveling prison wagon filled with prisoners crosses the party's path. One of the party members recognises one of the prisoners as a childhood friend.
49	队伍遇到一队送葬者，他们正将一位当地民间英雄的遗体运往其安息之地。 The party comes across a procession of mourners who are transporting the body of a local folk hero to his final resting place.
50	一对木精灵正在为偷猎者设置陷阱。如果队伍证明自己是森林之友，精灵将带他们前往一个充满灭绝和巨型生物的超维度自然保护区。 A pair of wood elves are seen setting traps for poachers. If the party proves to be friends of the forest, the elves will take them to an extradimensional nature preserve full of extinct and oversized creatures.
51	一名受伤的赏金猎人从灌木丛中踉跄而出，手臂中箭，无力垂落。他告诉玩家，他和同伴追踪三名臭名昭著的强盗到附近的山林，却遭到伏击。同伴已死，他需要取回同伴的吊坠交给遗孀。若玩家协助他抓捕强盗，他愿将200金币赏金的一半分给他们。 A wounded bounty hunter stumbles out of the bushes. He has taken an arrow through the arm, which now hangs limp. He tells the players that he and his partner tracked three infamous bandits to a wooded hill nearby, but they were ambushed. His partner was killed. He needs to retrieve a locket from his partner for the man’s widow. He will give the players half of the 200 gold coin bounty if they help him capture the bandits.
52	两名骑士，一位盾上绘有潜鸟，另一位盾上蓝底白星，正激烈交战。他们正在解决两家之间的世仇，即使付出生命也在所不惜。 Two knights, one with a loon on his shield and one with a white star on an azure field, are observed, locked in battle. They are settling a feud between their two houses, even if it means death.
53	队伍看到一群手持临时武器和火把的镇民向附近城市进发。他们宣称要讨伐一位地方小领主，因为他的税收太高。若发生战斗，他们必将惨遭屠戮。 The party sees a crowd of townsfolk equipped with makeshift weapons and torches marching towards a nearby city. They proclaim that they are going to do battle with a minor local lord because his taxes are too high. If there is a fight, they will certainly be slaughtered.
54	队伍遇到一位镇民正在与一位旅行商人争吵。镇民声称他购买了50份神奇药剂，但商人给他的箱子里只有46份。商人辩称顾客一定是喝掉了四份药剂，因为他“有一套系统”。争执的焦点是8枚金币。 The party comes across a townsman who is arguing with a traveling salesman. He claims that he paid for 50 miracle cures, but the crate the salesman gave him only contained 46. The salesman claims that the customer must have drunk four of the doses of the cure because he “has a system”. The dispute is over 8 gold pieces.
55	一队身着深灰色长袍、头戴两侧有大型圆点状帽兜的宗教游行队伍，形似猫头鹰头部。他们手持猫头鹰羽毛、活睡鼠置于需六人共抬的陶制镀金睡鼠饲养箱（用于育肥食用睡鼠的容器栖息地），以及数百只死老鼠和小鼠，尾巴被串在游行队伍间的杆子上。若细查，这些啮齿动物体内藏有小宝石，每颗价值10x1d10金币。他们向你提供由小米、干果和蜂蜜制成的小蛋糕，形状可疑地酷似猫头鹰的食丸。 A religious procession of many people in dark gray robes and hoods with large rounded points on the sides reminiscent of an owl's head. They are carrying owl feathers, live dormice in a clay and gilt glirarium (container habitat for fattening dormice for eating) large enough that it takes six people to carry it, and several hundred dead rats and mice strung up by their tails on poles carried between the processionals. If inspected closely, the rodents have a small gem hidden inside worth 10x1d10 gp each. They offer you little cakes made of millet, dried fruit, and honey, that are shaped suspiciously like owl pellets.
56	一只巨大的绿龙从队伍正上方飞过，向东而去。或许他们可以朝那个方向前进，找到它的巢穴？如果他们决定跟随龙的踪迹，将会在一处岩石突出的侧面发现一个巨大的洞穴入口。 A massive green dragon flies right over the party, headed east. Maybe they can travel in that direction and find its lair? If they do decide to follow the trail of the dragon, they will find a massive cave entrance on the side of a rocky outcropping.
57	你遇到一位年长的绅士，他正沿着小路行走，身后跟着六只小狗。每只狗都系着一条小牵引绳，绳子连在他装满狗衣服和玩具的大背包上。过去几年里，这位男士训练这些狗表演各种把戏。他正从一个镇子到另一个镇子旅行，试图成为一名著名的表演者。 You come across an older gentleman traveling down the path with a group of 6 small dogs walking behind him. He has them each on a small leash that is attached to his large backpack, filled with dog clothes and toys. Over the last few years, this man has trained these dogs to perform tricks. He is traveling from town to town to try and become a famous performer.
58	队伍遇到一群卫兵，正将他们敬爱的伯爵夫人的遗体运回故乡。交谈中，卫兵们怀疑其中涉及阴谋，请求冒险者们协助调查。 The party comes across a group of guardsmen transporting the corpse of their beloved countess back to her homeland. Upon conversation, the guardsmen believe foul play was involved and ask the adventurers if they could help investigate.
59	路边发现一个决心逃往远方城市的男孩。他身材瘦小，几乎打不过任何东西。他恳求着要加入队伍，与他们一同冒险。 A young boy is found on the roadside intent on running away to a far away city. He is small and would surely lose a fight to just about anything. He begs and pleads to come with the party and join them on their quest.
60	玩家们看到一群守卫正在焚烧一片庄稼，以此惩戒一位未缴税的农民。农民正在向田地旁一个稻草人般的雕像乞求，不要伤害守卫或下令的贵族。 The players see a group of guards burning a field of crops to make an example of a farmer for not paying his taxes. The farmer is begging to a scarecrow-like effigy next to the field to not harm the guards or the noble who ordered it.
61	远处一座小山顶上矗立着废墟。或许是战争将其摧毁，但无人确切知晓。山顶有一座石制祭坛，供奉着一位混沌邪恶的神祇。任何善良角色在此都会感到一种压抑的不安、恐惧与厄运。 A hill in the distance is crowned with ruins. War may have laid it to waste, but no one is quite sure. On the top of the hill is a stone altar dedicated to a chaotic evil deity. Any good character here will feel an oppressive sense of unease, fear and doom.
62	路边的守卫正将一名偷猎者从树林中拖出。他被铐着手铐，哭泣着说他只是为了养活家人才这么做，恳求守卫们发发慈悲。其中一名守卫手里提着那人猎杀的两只野鸡。 Road wardens are dragging a poacher out of the woods. He is manacled, and sobbing that he only did it to feed his family. He begs them to be merciful. One of the road wardens carries the two pheasants that the man killed.
63	一位妇女和六个小孩乘坐牛车接近。他们看起来脏兮兮、疲惫不堪且忧心忡忡，但如果队伍友好，母亲会分享她的故事：父亲抛弃了家庭，他们再也负担不起以前的家。母亲愿意给队伍一枚金币，请求他们陪同前往下一个村庄。有传言说该地区有狼群出没，他们害怕在天黑前无法到达城镇。 A woman and six small children approach in an ox-drawn wagon. They appear dirty, tired and apprehensive, but if the party is friendly the mother will share her story: the father has run out on his family, and they could no longer afford to live in their previous home. The mother offers the party a single gold coin if they would accompany them to the next village. Rumor has it there are wolves in the area, and they are scared they won't make it to town before nightfall.
64	队伍遇到一片延伸到道路两旁的墓地。所有墓碑上的名字都被仔细而精确地凿掉了。 The party comes across a graveyard stretching to both sides of the road. The names have been carefully and precisely chipped off of all the headstones.
65	远处可见一座古老的风车。若队伍靠近，会发现一位古怪的老妇人站在门口，邀请玩家入内过夜。玩家可能以为她是女巫或巫婆，但她完全无害，只有善意。 An old windmill can be seen in the distance. If the party approaches, they find a strange old lady in the doorway inviting the players inside to camp for the night. The players may think she is a witch or a hag, but she is completely harmless and only has good intentions.
66	队伍看见三名脏兮兮的农民乘坐一辆极其华丽的马车从他们身边驶过。他们紧张地微笑着向你们挥手。敏锐的眼睛会注意到马车侧面有一抹血迹。 The party sees a trio of dirty peasants riding past them on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at your group. A keen eye will notice a smear of blood on the side of the carriage.

68	一场最近的暴风雨肆虐了森林，道路上布满了大小不一的断枝。幸好树木本身依然挺立，但原本整洁的铺砌道路已变得难以通行。 A recent storm has ravaged the woods, and the road is covered with broken branches of varying sizes. Thankfully the trees themselves are still upright, but the normally clean paved road has become difficult terrain.
69	路旁矗立着一座雕刻精美的白色大理石方尖碑，高耸入云，俯瞰四周。能说精灵语或有精灵血统的人会认出这是一块精灵天气石。每天，方尖碑表面的精灵符文都会变换形状，向阅读者揭示明日的天气情况。 Off to the side of the road is an obelisk of carved white marble. It stands tall and overlooks the area. Those who can speak elvish or have elven ancestry will recognize this as an elven weather stone. Every day, the elven ruins on the face of the obelisk change shapes and reveal to the reader what the weather will be like tomorrow.

73	发现一处被遗弃的营地，遗留的物品显示居住者匆忙消失。火堆仍有余温，却不见人影。在帐篷内的物品中，队伍找到一张无特征的黏土面具。注视它的人会感到一种逐渐升起的低沉的恐惧。 An abandoned campsite is discovered, with belongings left behind as if the occupants vanished in a hurry. The fire is still warm, yet no one can be found. Within the belongings, the party finds a featureless clay mask inside of the tent. Those who look upon it begin to feel a low dread beginning to boil within them.
74	清晨，队伍发现巨型青蛙正在翻找他们的物品，寻找食物。目前它们并不具有敌意。 In the morning, the party finds giant frogs rummaging through their stuff, searching for food. They're not hostile, for now.
75	一位小有名气的诗人正与玩家同路而行。诗人开始向队伍询问关于他们冒险的随机问题。下次玩家进入酒馆时，会听到诗人正在吟唱一首关于他们的叙事诗。 A poet of some renown is traveling the same direction as the players. The poet begins asking the party random questions about their adventures. The next time the players enter a tavern, they hear the poet reciting a ballad about the party.

78	路边堆满了泥土和刚挖的坑。如果队伍调查，他们会发现一个凶残的盗墓贼仍在其中一个坑中挖掘。如果被质问，此人会声称拥有一张地图，上面标有一位在战斗中阵亡并被埋葬在此地的贵族战士的无名坟墓。 The side of the road is marked with piles of dirt and freshly dug holes. If the party investigates, they will find a grizzly graverobber still actively digging in one of the holes. If confronted, the man will claim to be in possession of a map showing the unmarked grave of a noble warrior who fell in battle and was buried somewhere in this area.
79	一群强盗在玩家行进的路上巧妙放置了一辆坏掉的马车。若玩家下车查看，强盗便会从藏身处跳出，要求他们掏空口袋。 A group of bandits have strategically placed a broken down cart in the middle of the road the players are traveling on. If they get out to explore, the bandits jump out of hiding and demand they empty their pockets.

81	队伍遇到一位同行的精灵侦察兵。他非常友好，装备精良，衣着和饱经风霜的面容显示出他是一位多年征战的战士。他邀请队伍稍作休息，享用一些他的精灵口粮，并分享他们可能有的新闻和谣言，以便他回报给他的领地和国王。他也非常乐意用自己旅途中收集到的一些消息和谣言作为交换，比如其他路人的信息、附近的景点，或者其他可能的剧情线索。 The party comes across an elven scout traveling the same road. He is very friendly, well-armed, and his clothing and weathered face show that he is a warrior of many years. He invites the party to rest a while, enjoy some of his elven rations, and share news and rumors they might have for him to report back to his hold and king. He is perfectly willing to share some of news and rumors he’s already collected in his journey in exchange, such as other passersby, nearby points of interest, or perhaps other plot hooks.
82	一座风化的石堆矗立在十字路口，石块被精心摆放。石堆顶上放着新鲜的鲜花和水果，但四下无人。 A weathered stone cairn lies at a crossroads, the stones arranged with deliberate care. A recent offering of flowers and fruit sits atop it, yet no one is in sight.

He seems to have taken an aggressive wound to the chest, but yet lives. If he is healed or brought to town in time, he will be forever in the party's debt.

86	玩家们在一条漫长的路旁发现了一座看似废弃的小教堂。窗户早已被木板封死，门板也脱落在地。如果玩家们进去探查，会发现一个前强盗在里面搭了个小营地。他对玩家们很友善，并请求他们帮忙。在附近的一个王国里，他的兄弟被囚禁，正面临生死审判。他请求玩家们能否帮忙把他兄弟从监狱里救出来。 The players come across a seemingly abandoned chapel off the side of a long road. The windows have long since been boarded up and the door is laying on the ground off its hinges. If the players investigate inside, they will find an ex-bandit has made a small camp inside. He is kind to the players and asks if they can help him. In a nearby kingdom, his brother is being held captive and is on trial for his life. He asks the players if they could break his brother out of prison.
87	"七个盲人乞丐从队伍旁经过，每人抓住前一个人的绳带。领头的乞丐用拐杖探路，队伍最后的人摇晃着装有几枚铜便士的木杯。“施舍给盲人吧！”他喊道。他们正在前往最近的首都城市朝圣。 Seven blind beggars pass the party. Each holds on to the rope belt of the man in front of him. The lead beggar feels with a cane. The last man in the chain shakes a wooden mug with a few brass pennies in it. ""Alms for the blind!"" He shouts. They are on a pilgrimage to the nearest capital city."
88	一群满身泥土的矮人矿工从路旁接近队伍，提出用非常珍贵的宝石换取一些麦酒和食物（“不要干粮，要真正的食物！”）。他们刚发现了一处巨大的宝石矿藏，想要庆祝一番。 A pack of dirt-covered Dwarf miners approach the party from off the road, offering to trade very valuable gems for some ale and food ('not trail rations, real food!'). They have just struck upon a massive gem deposit and wish to celebrate.
89	森林中有一片空地，显然非自然形成。树木被烧焦，浓厚的魔法残留附着在焦木表面，甚至弥漫在空气中。空地中央是一座小屋，似乎是可怕炼金术爆炸的现场。屋内有烧焦的尸体，四处散落的破碎小瓶，地板上混合药水的水洼，还有动物造访此地的痕迹。 In the forest there is a clearing, though clearly not of natural origin. Trees are burnt, thick magical residue clings to the surface of the charred wood and even lingers in the air itself. At the center is a shack that appears to be the site of a terrible alchemical explosion. There are burnt corpses in the shack, shattered vials everywhere and puddles of mixed potions on the floor, and evidence of animals visiting the site.
90	当队伍穿过一片茂密的林地时，他们注意到头顶的树木上布满了密集的蜘蛛网。蛛网间隐藏着数十只巨型蜘蛛，在树梢上无声地窸窣作响，静静注视着队伍。 As the party travels through a heavily wooded area, they notice that the trees above them are filled with dense spider webs. Hidden amongst the webs are dozens of giant spiders, chittering and watching the party silently in the treetops.
91	一大群牲畜覆盖了前方的道路，宛如一片嘶鸣的皮毛与犄角之海。远处可见几位牧羊人驱赶着动物前行，但牲畜数量如此之多，全部通过需要数分钟。队伍可以尝试穿越兽群，但必须进行敏捷检定，以在逆流而上的兽群中取得进展。 A massive herd of livestock covers the road ahead resembling a sea of braying fur and horns. In the distance a few shepherds can be seen ushering the animals along, but such is the amount of the creatures, it will take several minutes for them to all pass. The party can attempt to wade through the herd, but must take dexterity checks to make any progress in walking against the tide of them.

It has been dragging small and medium-sized livestock back to its web. The group has gathered together to hunt it down.
95	路边空地上生长着一簇簇色彩斑斓的蘑菇，大小从一寸到几英尺不等。很久以前，一位旅人在此遗落了一瓶魔法药剂，随着时间的推移，药剂渗入土壤，导致蘑菇发生变异并疯狂生长。空气中弥漫着孢子，其中一些具有致幻效果。 An assortment of multi-colored mushrooms, ranging in size from an inch to a few feet tall, can be found in a clearing on the roadside. Long ago, a traveler dropped a magic potion in the area and over time, the contents of the potion leaked into the ground, causing the mushrooms to change and grow. The air is thick with spores, some of which have psychedelic properties.
96	队伍在路边遇到一位正在采集蘑菇的女子。她在寻找一种特定蘑菇，经过适当处理后可以成为致命毒药。如果她感到与玩家交谈自在，她会透露计划毒死她出轨的丈夫。 The party comes across a woman collecting mushrooms on the side of the road. She is looking for a specific kind of mushroom that, when handled properly, can act as a lethal poison. If she feels comfortable talking with the players, she reveals that she plans to kill her cheating husband.
97	三位农夫赶着一小群山羊和一头牛经过。几分钟后，一个男人跑过来，眼睛青肿，衣服凌乱，手里握着耙子。他恳求队伍告诉他强盗带着他所有的牲畜往哪去了。 Three farmers pass by with a small herd of goats and a cow. Several minutes later, a man comes running along with a black eye, roughed up clothes, and holding a rake. He pleads with the party to tell him where the bandits went with all his livestock.
