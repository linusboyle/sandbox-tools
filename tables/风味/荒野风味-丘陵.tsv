1d36	荒野风味-丘陵
1	石质碎石坡使得攀登这些山丘比预期的更为棘手 A Stony Scree makes ascending some of these Hills trickier than it should be
2	由于径流的影响，这里的地面柔软而富有弹性，每走一步都会下陷 Soft and spongy due to run-off, the ground here has a lot of give with each step
3	深褐色的沟壑在最高的山丘上蜿蜒曲折地延伸 Deep Brown Furrows zigzag over and around the tallest Hills here
4	覆盖着低矮杂乱的灌木丛，仿佛鸟鸣声在其中生机勃勃地跃动。 Blanketed with small, scraggly Bushes that seem to be alive with Birdsong
5	草地因放牧动物啃食而短促，它们似乎偏爱阳光充足的一侧 Grass cropped close by Grazing Animals, who seem to favor the sunny side
6	花岗岩杂乱堆积，早已滚落，在底部形成石堆 Jumbles of Granite, long since tumbled down, form piles near the bases
7	微风中，小溪的潺潺声几乎难以听见 The babble of a tiny Brook is barely audible over the breeze
8	裸露无草的坡面上，可见橙红色调的彩色地层 Colorful Strata, in shades of orange and red, are visible on bare, grassless sides
9	古代梯田耕作技术的痕迹仍依稀可见 Traces of ancient Terrace Farming techniques are still barely visible
10	山坡上攀爬着茂密的藤蔓，叶子深绿，茎秆粗壮木质。 Scaling the slopes are lush Vines with deep green leaves and thick, woody stalks
11	这片丘陵中的一处凹陷，若眯眼细看，令人联想到骷髅的形状。 Dimples in one of the Hills here make it reminiscent of a Skull if you squint
12	看似巨大爪痕的深沟和凹槽遍布山坡 What look like humungous Claw-marks form deep gashes and gouges on Slopes
13	小型动物骨骼散落在某种废弃巢穴的入口处 Small Animal Bones liter the entrance to a disused Den of some kind
14	在一座小山的山脊附近，立着一块木质的某种墓碑 Near the Crest of a smaller Hill stands a wooden Grave Marker of some kind
15	一座可能曾是塔楼的基座，矗立在这片最高处 Foundations of what may have once been a Tower squat on the tallest here
16	经风霜雕琢，裸露的山坡上顽强地生长着一簇簇野草 Sculpted by Wind and Weather, the bare Slopes are home to tufts of stubborn grass

18	砂岩峭壁从这些低矮石山的峰顶探出头来 Sandstone Bluffs peek out from the Summits of these squat and stony Hills
19	一把适合巨人手掌的鹤嘴锄直插云霄，深深嵌入一座小山中 A Pickaxe, fit for a Giant's Hands juts skyward, driven into one of the Hills
20	土壤逐渐转变为来自史前海床的沙子，地面上点缀着石化的贝壳 Soil gives way to Sand from a prehistoric Seabed, stone shells dot the ground
21	一棵古老云杉的扭曲树干紧紧依附在逐渐侵蚀的斜坡上 Gnarled Trunk of an ancient Spruce clings precariously to an eroding slope
22	这些山丘异常整齐，你无法确定它们是自然形成的丘陵还是古老的墓冢。 Unnervingly uniform, you are unsure if these are Hills or ancient Barrows
23	在小丘的背风处可见一处新近营火的残迹 Remains of a recent Campfire are visible on the leeward side of a hummock
24	几只野兔在此大嚼芬芳的三叶草，边吃边凝视 Gorging on the fragrant Clover here, several Hares munch and stare
25	登高望远时，你注意到了边缘；这些似乎是陨石坑。 Upon ascending for a better view, you notice the Lip; these appear to be Craters
26	此处生长的坚韧荆棘灌木上垂挂着红玉髓色的浆果 Carnelian-colored Berries droop from the tenacious Throned Bushes that grow here
27	如同柴火般堆叠，几尊雕像的大理石肢体被叠放在一座山丘之上 Piled like Firewood, the Marble Limbs of several statues are stacked atop a Tor
28	巨大的岩石巧妙地平衡在低矮的山峰上，较软的石头早已被侵蚀殆尽 Large Boulders are balanced preciously on the squat peaks, softer stone long eroded
29	散布着树桩，伐木工已将昔日矗立于此的参天大树砍伐殆尽 Sprinkled with Stumps, Loggers have clear-cut the once mighty Trees that stood here
30	大多已倒塌，这些布满苔藓的巨大石块曾构成一座立石圈。 Mostly toppled, the huge lichen-scarred Stones here once formed a Standing Circle
31	古老的树根从短峭的崖壁蜿蜒而出，成为几处鸟巢的家园 Old Tree Roots snake out of the stubby Cliffside, home to several Bird Nests
32	昔日播种的谷物如今在此地野蛮生长，随风摇曳 Cereals sown long ago now grow feral here, swaying in the wind
33	山丘一侧刻有一匹马的粉笔轮廓 Excised into the side of the Hill here is the Chalky outline of a Horse
34	在这片崎岖、喀斯特般的地貌中，裂缝、尖峰和山脊随处可见 Fissures, Spires, and Ridges appear in this rough, karst-like landscape
35	一条蜿蜒的兽径在这些山丘间上下穿行 A meandering Game Trail snakes up and down each of the Hills here
36	低洼地区因最近的暴雨而积水，山丘如同岛屿般孤立。 Low-lying areas here are inundated from recent rainstorms, Hills are like islands
