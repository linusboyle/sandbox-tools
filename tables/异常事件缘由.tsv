1d20	异常事件缘由
1-4	毫无缘由。这类事情就是会莫名其妙地发生。 No reason. Stuff like this just happens.
5-6	这些事件以定期或半定期的频率发生。有1到3的几率（六分之一的概率）可以预测此类事件的发生，否则它们会在半定期的时间间隔内随机发生。 These events occur on a regular or semi-regular basis. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance such occurrences can be predicted, otherwise they happen at random but semi-regular intervals.
7	正常世界与元素位面之间的位面边界减弱，导致异常天气现象增多。 Planar boundaries between the normal world and an elemental plane have weakened, resulting in an increase in unusual weather.
8-9	这是恶意法术的结果。某个存在施放了法术，意图在土地上制造混乱。无论事件描述中给出的持续时间如何，有1/6到3/6的几率，该事件不会结束，直到作恶者被绳之以法。 It is the result of a malicious spell. Some being has cast a spell to wreak havoc upon the land. There is a 1-3 in 6 chance that, regardless of the duration given in the event description, it will not end until the miscreant is brought to justice.*
10-11	这是某个增益法术的效果所致。* It is the result of a beneficial spell.*
12-13	一位德鲁伊或自然守护者为了恢复平衡而引发了这一事件。或许人类数量过于庞大，气候模式的改变将导致农作物减产。 A druid or other guardian of nature has precipitated the event in order to achieve balance. Perhaps humanity has been getting to numerous, and a change in weather patterns will result in smaller crop yields.
14-15	这是某个强大法术的无意副作用。有1-4的几率，这种异常现象是一次性的，否则，随着施法者或相关巫师团体继续施展该法术，事件将以越来越频繁的频率发生。 It is an unintentional side-effect of some powerful spell. There is a 1-4 in 6 chance the anomaly is a one-time event, but otherwise the events will happen with increasing frequency as the wizard or coven in question continues to cast the offending spell.
16-17	某位神明或强大的存在决定将此事降临于人民，作为惩罚（或在有益事件发生时，作为恩赐）。有1-2的几率事件将持续，直到神明的愤怒得到平息。 Some god or mighty being has decided to visit the event upon the people as punishment (or, when a beneficial event occurs, as a boon). There is a 1-2 in 6 chance the event will continue until the god's anger has been sated.
18	这一事件是预言的一部分。 The event is part of a prophecy.
19	该事件被预言为一种预兆，预示着某件大事（如可怕怪物的诞生、英雄的陨落、英雄时代的终结）。 The event is foretold as an omen that signifies something (the birth of a dreadful monster, the death of a hero, the end of the Age of Heroes).
20	这是由一件强大的神器引起的。 It is caused by a powerful artifact.
