21	坚韧的翠绿蕨类簇拥着雄伟的云杉树干，以躲避烈日的炙烤 Hardy, emerald Ferns crowd impressive Spruce Trunks to avoid a punishing sun

26	这里的部分落叶松已转为耀眼的黄色，大约每五棵中就有一棵 Some of the Tamaracks here have turned a brilliant yellow, maybe one in five
27	树木上留有高水位痕迹，而森林地面却似乎被清扫得一尘不染 High water marks on the Trees, while the forest floor seems to have been swept clean
