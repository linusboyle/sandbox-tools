1d70	节假日
1	回归节——节日期间全天敞开家门以示庆祝。纪念一支圣武士冒险队伍消灭了一群在夜间掳走人们进行仪式的女巫后，无数失踪者重返家园的日子。 Festival of Returns – Celebrated by keeping one’s door open all day during festivities. In remembrance of the day that countless missing people returned home after an adventuring group of paladins vanquished a coven of hags who had been stealing people away in the night for their rituals
2	织工之夜——为布艺工匠举办的巧妙节日。庆祝当地森林蜘蛛群向镇民求助，以保护其巢穴免受觅食的鸡蛇兽侵扰。本地女裁缝们响应号召，编织出坚固的大布网，供蜘蛛藏身，直至鸡蛇兽被处理。 Weaver’s Eve – An artful festival for fabric makers. Celebrates the day when the nearby forest’s local spider population came to the townspeople asking for help to safeguard their nests from foraging cockatrices. The local seamstresses responded by making large, sturdy fabric webs for the spiders to hide in until the cockatrices could be dealt with.
3	石之日——作为石匠技艺的认可日庆祝。起源于数百年前的一个纪念日，当时猎人回到镇子，发现所有居民都被游荡的美杜莎变成了石头。 Day of Stone – Celebrated as a masonry recognition day. Began as a day of remembrance some hundreds of years before when Hunters returned to town only to find that every person had been turned to stone by a roaming Medusa.
4	怨灵节——人们在这一天互相倾诉怨气，以免因压抑而被怨灵缠身。此节日起源于很久以前，一位死灵法师对小镇施加了沉默的敌意诅咒，直到人们开始互相残杀，随后他将死者复活，组建了一支亡灵军队。 The Haunt – A day when people offload their grievances with one another, lest they be haunted by holding it in. In recognition of the day long ago when a necromancer bestowed a curse of silent aggression over the town until people began killing one another, then raising them for his army of dead.
5	蜜月节——每隔几个月，月亮会连续两三个夜晚升起时散发出金色光芒。在名为&lt;我不擅长取名&gt;的小镇上，人们相信月亮之所以如此，是因为某处有人找到了真爱。在这些日子里，街道上摆满了桌子，人们邀请他人在这金色月光下共度约会，无论是友情还是爱情（类似于现实世界的情人节约会）。 The Honey Moon festival – Every few months, the moon will rise with a golden glow for two or three nights. In the little town of &amp;lt;im bad at names&amp;gt; they say that the moon does this when someone, somewhere, finds true love. During these days, tables are set out in the streets and people ask others to join them on dates, platonic and romantic, underneath the golden moonlight (similar to real world valentines dates).
6	酒吧凳焚烧节——在一次事件中，一只伪装成酒吧凳的拟态怪咬掉了一位可怜顾客的屁股，酒馆里醉醺醺的顾客们便在街上烧掉了所有的酒吧凳。从此，一个下午的饮酒和用酒吧凳及其他易燃物搭建街头篝火的活动，成为了一个年度节日，并蔓延到城市里所有的酒馆。酒馆们用增加的收入购买新的酒吧凳。 The Barstool Burning – After an incident where a mimic disguised as a barstool bit off a chunk of a poor patron’s bum, the tavern’s inebriated clientele burned all its barstools in the street. An afternoon of drinking and building street bonfires made of barstools and other flammables has since become an annual holiday that has spread to all the taverns in the city. The taverns use the bump in proceeds to buy new barstools.
7	怪物游行——每年一次，区域内所有城市举行游行，参与者身着精心制作的怪物服装。大城市可能雇佣法师施展特效，并制作多层楼高的巨兽，安装在带活动部件的轮车上，参与者可乘坐在内。游行的高潮是“神圣圣骑士”，他身着华丽的盔甲和道具武器，驱赶“怪物”。圣骑士角色通过人气竞赛或其他方式选出，几乎从不是真正的圣骑士。该游行纪念一次通过制造街道已被恐怖怪物占领的假象，吓退外国进攻，并轻松击败驱赶它们的守卫的计谋。 Monster Parade – Once a year, all the cities in region hold a parade where all the participants wear elaborate monster costumes. Larger cities may employ magicians for special effects and have multistory beasts mounted on wheeled carts with movable parts and participants riding inside. The final attraction in the parade is the “holy paladin” with an elaborate armor outfit and costume weapons who is driving the “monsters” away. The role of the paladin is chosen by popularity contest or some other method, and is almost never an actual paladin. The parade celebrates a plot to deter a foreign attack by making it appear that terrifying monsters had already overrun the streets, yet they were easily defeated and driven off by guards.
8	沐浴与游泳节——这一“节日”起源于一个间歇性遭受吸血鬼困扰的地区。每当发现又一具被吸干的人时，领地内的所有男女老少都会被召集起来，涉水渡过一条浅河。行动不便者被抬着并浸入水中。随后进行人口普查，任何未到场或拒绝参加的人（包括访客）都会被抓住并浸入水中。等待审判结束的无聊青年很快在河流较深处发起了一场如今已成传统的游泳比赛。多亏了一对富有创意的游吟诗人，一个反复上演的喜剧表演应运而生。两位诗人分别扮演一名迟钝的守卫和一只吸血鬼，坐在一个大木浴缸里，表演“直男与智者”的小品。这一喜剧表演以教育意义收尾：它讲述了吸血鬼的能力与弱点，并警告人们不要明确邀请任何人进入你的家，或是你的浴缸。 The Bath and Swim – This “festival” originated in a region with intermittent vampire problems. When another drained person is found, every man, woman, and child in the territory are ordered to assemble and wade across a shallow river. Immobile people are carried and then submerged. A census is then taken, and anyone who didn’t show up or refused (even visitors) is captured and dunked. Bored youths waiting for the trials to end soon started a now traditional swimming contest in the deeper part of the river. Thanks to a pair of enterprising visiting bards, a recurring comedy act developed. Two bards playing an oblivious guard and a vampire sit in a single large wooden bath and deliver “Straight Man and Wise Guy” skits. The comedy act has an informative end: it addresses vampire powers and weaknesses, and cautions against explicitly inviting anyone into your home, or your bath.
9	化装舞会——上流社会与贵族阶层的盛会。参与者身着高度遮掩的面具与服饰，在舞厅中翩翩起舞。由于身份看似被隐藏，人们得以尽情释放。挑战权威的言论、奇装异服、放荡舞姿、公开示爱、失礼之举、粗俗笑话及公开八卦均被允许。许多被压制与压迫群体的斗士首次在此发表宣言。对于调查贵族联盟与行径者、寻求宫廷影响力的社交攀爬者，以及寻找高层保护与买家的地下世界盗贼而言，化装舞会不容错过。 Masquerade ball – An event for the upper classes and nobility. Participants ballroom dance while wear highly concealing masks and costumes. Because everyone’s identities are ostensibly hidden, participants are expected to cut loose. Statements challenging authority, outrageous clothing, lascivious dancing, public displays of affection, impoliteness, crude jokes, and open gossip is also permitted. Many champions of silenced and oppressed factions voiced their first manifestos here. The masquerade ball is a can’t-miss for anyone investigating aristocratic allegiances and doings, social climbers seeking courtly influence, and underworld rogues looking for high level protection and buyers.
10	地下墓穴狂欢节——每年一次，在大城市中，市民们前往地下墓穴，庆祝又一年生命的延续，并敬仰那些安息于此的逝者。他们通过妥善清理和整理已在墓穴中存放一年的遗骨，将其排列成精致的结构和图案。任何受损的骨头都会在城市广场的巨大火堆中焚烧，其灰烬被用作地下骨雕的砂浆。他们还会向那些负责将尸体分解至骨头的甲虫和老鼠献上供品。在墓穴清理完毕，前一年的逝者得到妥善安置后，便迎来一整天的庆祝活动。狂欢者们点亮墓穴和隧道，在街道上下游行庆祝，佩戴着甲虫、老鼠和骷髅的面具，以驱散可能潜藏在城市地下黑暗深处的恶灵和居民。 Catacomb Carnival – Once per year in the great cities the citizens head to the catacombs to celebrate another year alive and honor the dead interred in them by properly cleaning and arranging the bones of those that have been in the catacombs for a year into elaborate structures and designs. Any bones that are damaged in any way are burned in a great pyre in the city square and the ashes are used in the mortar of the bone sculptures below. They also leave offerings to the beetles and rats that do the job of stripping the bodies down to the bone. After the catacombs have been cleaned and the years previous dead have been attended to there is a day and night of celebration where revelers light the catacombs and tunnels and celebrate in procession above and below the streets wearing masks of beetles, rats, and skeletons to ward off any dark spirits and denizens that might also haunt the dark recesses below the city.
11	吟游者假面舞会——一年一度的节日，来自各王国的吟游诗人齐聚一堂，共享欢乐时光。每位诗人都渴望获得这场盛会的邀请，但只有少数人能被授予“吟游之星”的殊荣。此舞会源于疯子格里克的悲剧。格里克是一位忠实的弄臣，博学的吟游诗人，他连续三个月让失眠的国王开怀大笑。然而，格里克终究只是凡人，一位普通的诗人，当国王终于下令他停止玩笑时，他倒地不起，化作冰冷的石头。此节日旨在纪念格里克及所有吟游诗人，他们为成为王国中最杰出的艺术灵魂而不懈追求，以及格里克为博国王一笑所做出的可怕牺牲。 The Minstrel Masquerade – A yearly festival wherein bards gather from every kingdom to enjoy one another’s company. Every bard seeks an invitation to such a jovial event, but only a few will be deemed worthy of winning a “Bardy.” The masquerade’s origin stems from the tragedy of Gerrick the Mad. Gerrick was a loyal jester, a bard of Lore, whom kept his sleepless king laughing for 3 months straight. Unfortunately Gerrick was only a man, a simple bard, and when the king finally gave word for him to stop jesting, he fell to the ground, stone dead. This festival exists to honor Gerrick and other bards alike for their insatiable desire to be the best artistic minds in their kingdoms, and the horrid sacrifice Gerrick made for the price of his King’s smile.
12	鲑鱼腐烂季——每年此时，栖息在附近河流中的巨型鲑鱼会在沿岸村庄完成它们一年的腐烂。每年鲑鱼产卵后死亡，尸体漂浮至岸边，经过大约一年的腐烂，会在其遗骸上形成一种特殊的迷幻河蘑菇。这些蘑菇被收集起来，在费尔伯格社区中作为成人礼分享。 The Salmon Bulb Run – It is this time each year that the giant salmon (which dwell within the nearby rivers) finish their yearly rot on the shores of nearby villages. You see, each year the salmon spawn, die, then float to shore causing a special type of psychedelic river mushroom to form on their carcasses (after they rot for approximately a year). These mushrooms are collected and shared amongst the Firbolg community as a right of passage.
13	冬日祭典日——前一天准备，从圣树上砍下一根枝条，雕刻成碗，碗内刻下符文，祈求来年春天及下一年的愿望：财富、生育或健康，碗中放置一支特制蜡烛。午夜后，蜡烛由寺庙点燃的特殊篝火点燃。正午时分举行特别仪式，祭司吟诵仪式咒语，祈求城市免受冬日之灵侵扰直至来年。仪式持续五小时后，人们饮酒并从碗杯中啜饮肉汤（蜡烛仍希望点燃），直至午夜吹熄蜡烛。若蜡烛提前熄灭，来年将遭遇厄运。 Winter’s Ritual Day – To prepare the day before, a branch of the sacred tree is cut and carved into a bowl, in it, runes are scribed asking for what you want come Spring and the next year; fortune, fertility or good health and inside is placed a special candle. After midnight, the candle is lit by a special bonfire created by the temple. A special ceremony is held at midday, where the priest incants a ritual spell ceremony, asking that the city be warded from the Spirit of Winter till next year. After this ceremony, which lasts 5 hours, the people drink ale and sup broth from their bowl cup (candle still lit hopefully), until midnight when they blow out the candle. If your candle goes out beforehand, terrible luck will befall you in the coming year.
14	修补日——一个旨在改善社区、加强镇民间联系的节日。在这一天，裁缝、工匠、铁匠等手艺人放下手头工作，免费为社区居民提供小型项目服务。随着节日发展，其他人也开始向社区提供商品和服务：面包师赠送小食，酒馆免费提供饮品（每位顾客限一杯！），音乐家和艺术家则向所有人展示才华。许多人将此节日视为与邻居和社区增进感情的机会，而精明者则视之为自我宣传的良机。修补日的首要原则是，即便仅此一日，旧怨与争执被搁置，人们将社区置于个人之上，待次日一切如常。 Day of Mending – A celebration to better one’s community and strenghten the bonds between townsfolk, this holiday is a day when tailors, crafters, smithies and similar trades set aside their work for a day offer their services for free on small projects for members of their community. As the holiday has grown, it has become a tradition for others to offer their goods and services to the community as well: bakers give away small food stuffs, taverns offer drinks on the house (one per customer!), and musicians and artisans flaunt their talents to all. Many enjoy the holiday as an opportunity to bond with their neighbors and community, while the more savvy use it as an opportunity for self promotion. The primary tenet of the Day of Mending is that old grudges and quarrels are set aside, if only for the day, and folk put the community ahead of the individual before the old business resumes on the following day.
15	恋魂归来——每年有一夜，传说一对年轻男女的灵魂会回到他们逝去的小镇，寻找彼此。古老的故事讲述了这对恋人被迫分离，直到其中一人因悲痛而自杀，不久后其伴侣也追随而去。如今，镇上的老人们低声细语，称在恋魂归来之夜，曾瞥见半透明的绯红身影，时而为青年男子，时而为少女，游荡于镇中，轻叩家门，欲入内寻觅失落的爱人。镇民相信在门廊悬挂特定图腾可阻止恋魂造访，然而即便如此，每隔几年仍会有青年男女在恋魂归来之夜失踪，据信是被误认为失落伴侣的幽灵带走。 The Lovers’ Return – One night each year, it is said that the spirits of a young man and woman return to roam the town where they died, looking for each other. Old tales tell of the young lovers kept apart, until one committed suicide from grief, only to be shortly followed into death by their partner. Now, the oldest townsfolk whisper of seeing the crimson specter of half-seen figures, sometimes a young man, sometimes a young woman, roaming the town on the night of the Lovers’ Return, rapping lightly on the doors of homes to be let inside to search for their lost love. The townsfolk believe that hanging certain totems around their entryways will keep the lovers from coming to their doors, but even so, every few years a young man or a young woman goes missing on the Lover’s Return, presumably taken away by one of the specters mistaking them for their lost partner.
16	冬祭——一个古老的节日，主要由农村农耕社区庆祝，既是对古老神祇的敬奉，也是为即将到来的冬季做准备。秋收之后，每户人家分得一定数量的粮食，而大部分则被加工并密封在朴素的陶罐中，埋入地下，为寒冷饥饿的冬季储备。同时，村民们此时也会埋葬他们年幼的逝者：过去一年中夭折的婴儿和死胎，他们的遗体被处理后葬入涂黑的陶罐，作为对古老神祇的祭品。这些社区的老接生婆们常用故事来管教顽皮的孩子，讲述他们的哭闹和泪水如何渗入地下，导致黑陶罐破裂，促使罐中亡者爬出地面，带走不乖的男孩女孩。 Winter’s Offering – An old holiday, mostly celebrated by rural farming communities, it serves as both a celebration to venerate the old gods as well as preparing the villages for the winter to come. After the fall harvest, each household is granted a number of bushels of the food grown, while a large portion of it is prepared and sealed in unadorned clay urns to be buried in the ground and kept in reserve for the cold, hungry months of winter. As well, the villagers bury the bodies of their young at this time: the stillborn and the infants who passed in the previous year, their bodies prepared and buried in urns painted black, offerings to the old gods. The old midwives of such communities often keep unruly children in line with tales of how the cries and tears caused by misbehaving children echo into the ground and cause the blackened urns to crack, prompting their buried occupants to crawl their way out to the surface and drag away bad little boys and girls.
17	绶带节——纪念数个世纪前暴君王室的清除，当时统治家族被平民逐出城，他们在街头奔逃时衣物被剥下。各团体和家庭准备装饰着彩色绶带的假人，竞相制作最精美、最喜庆的假人。这些假人被高举在杆子上，穿过城市。队伍从皇家广场竞速至城门。人们沿街站立，试图在假人经过时抓取并撕下绶带和装饰物。节日气氛非常热烈，公众醉酒，年轻人追逐假人。 Festival of the Sashes – to commemorate the purge of a despotic royal lineage centuries ago, when the ruling family was chased out of town by the commoners, their clothing stripped of their bodies as they ran through the streets. Groups and families prepare mannequins adorned with colorful sashes, each trying to make theirs the most elaborate and festive. The mannequins are then hoisted on poles and carried through the city. The groups race from Royal Plaza to the city gates. People line the streets and try to grab and tear handfuls of the sashes and ornamentation off as the mannequins pass. The atmosphere is very festive with public drunkenness and groups of young people chasing after the mannequins.
18	休息周——邻居们轮流为彼此做饭。起源于一场瘟疫席卷小镇，有人康复而有人病倒的时期。 Week of Rest – Neighbors take turns cooking meals for each other. Based on when a plague swept through the town and some got better while others got sick.
19	纪念碑赛跑日——传说附近火山喷发摧毁旧镇后，许多村民在疏散家人后返回，将旧镇中心的石碑搬到新镇所在地。为纪念这一壮举，每年火山喷发周年日，镇民们组队携带纪念碑复制品，从旧村遗址赛跑到纪念碑现址。赛后，全镇共庆，享用“熔岩汤”（一种以番茄为底的辣味红汤）和纪念碑形状的面包卷。 Monument Race Day – It is said that when a near by volcano erupted destroying the old town, after evacuating their families many of the villagers returned to move the stone monument from the old town center to the new town’s location. In honor of this deed, every year on the anniversary of the eruption, the townspeople form teams that carry replica monuments in a race from the site of the old village to the monuments’s current location. Afterwards the town celebrates by having lava soup (a spicy red tomato based soup), with monument shaped bread rolls.
20	灰烬哀悼日——在纪念夺去数千人性命的大火灾周年之际，这是一个沉痛的反思日。正午第三声钟响，即火灾开始之时，人们开始默默从家中走出。每个人脸上都涂抹着煤灰和烟尘。特别虔诚的人或在那场火灾中失去一切的年长者可能会赤身裸体，全身涂满煤灰。市民们低头缓步绕行受灾最严重的街区，每分钟敲响一次钟声，悼念逝去的生命。日落时分，人们安静地返回家中。近来，人们开始在此后举办一场以腌肉、咸鱼和干果等保存食品为主的盛大宴会。 Lamentations of the Cinders – a somber day of reflection on the anniversary of the Great Fire that killed thousands. At third bell after noon, which is when the fire began, people begin silently filing from their homes. Everyone covers their faces with soot and ash. Particularly devout people or older folk who lost everything in the fire may go completely naked and cover their whole body in soot. Citizens keep their faces downcast as they slowly walk a circuit around the neighborhoods that were most affected. A bell tolls every minute for the lives that were lost. At sundown everyone quietly returns home. Recently people have begun to include a great feast of preserved foods, like jerky, salted fish, and dried fruit afterwards.
21	终潮之讯——传说曾有一位女巫少女爱上了一位水手。他出海后，她每日黄昏在悬崖边等待，直至潮水退尽，如此坚持了二十五年。在年末最后一夜，她终于得知爱人已逝。她诅咒并向上天发誓，再无人需如她般长久等待终局。她施展了某种未知的仪式，自那夜起，每年最后一天退潮时分，任何在悬崖边低语所爱之人名字者，或将听到名字回响，意味着对方仍健在，或将闻信天翁哀鸣，知晓其已逝。由此衍生出两场为期两夜的庆典，一场哀悼，一场欢庆，恋人们在此得知真相。许多单身参与者彼此间寻得慰藉乃至更多，绝非偶然。 Last Tidings – It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twentyfive years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other’s company.
22	瓜墙节——百年前，该城遭围困。入侵者攀墙欲入，却被农民击退，他们拆毁自家房屋，投石阻敌。节日当天，由委员会选出一段城墙，城中的年轻男子竞相攀爬。墙顶则站着同等数量的少女，手持熟透或腐烂的瓜果。传统上，首位登顶者有权选择并迎娶心仪之女。攀爬者受羽落术保护，并由手持毯子的长者接应。 Wall of Melons – A hundred years ago the city was under siege. The invaders climbed a wall to get inside only to be rebuffed by peasants who tore down their own homes to toss rocks down on the climbers. The day is celebrated by a committee selecting a portion of wall up witch a the town’s young men try to clamber. At top are an equal bumber of lasses armed with melons both ripe and rotten. It isbl traditional for the first climber up to ask for and be given the hand in marriage of his choice. The climbers are protected by feather fall spells and blanket carrying elders.
23	甜夜节——镇外果园的果树由当地洞穴中的蝙蝠授粉。这一事实直到百年前一只吸血鬼肆虐乡间才被发现。吸血鬼被追踪至洞穴并被驱逐，蝙蝠也随之四散。次年收成惨淡，直到一位游方圣者告诉村民必须将蝙蝠引回。他们通过在果园至洞穴的长路上倾倒糖浆和其他甜食实现了这一目标。此举奏效，并演变为一年一度的节日，以纪念并感谢蝙蝠。所用甜食变成了孩子们的糖果和成人的美酒。节日从黄昏的篝火开始，以长途徒步至洞穴为高潮。舞蹈和装扮盛行，还有许多蝙蝠主题的玩具和纪念品。 Sweet Night – The orchids of fruit trees in the town’s fields are pollinated by bats from a local cave. This wasn’t known until a hundred years ago when a vampire ravaged the country side. It was tracked back to the cave and burned out, scattering the bats as well. The next years harvests were bad until a traveling holy man told the villagers they must lure the vats back. This was done by pouring syrup and other sweets out on a long path from orchards to cave. It worked and has become an annual event to remind and thank the bats. The sweets used have become candies for children and alcohol for adults. It starts with a barnfire at dusk and culminates in a long hike to the cave. Dancing and costume wearing is common as well as many bat theme toys and souvenirs.
24	怪物大战——一个类似奥运会的体育盛事，包含多种竞技比赛和游戏。主要赛事是破坏德比风格的比赛，各组制作“怪物战车”。本质上是由人驾驶或驱动的战车或推车，被设计成世界上的各种怪物（龙、凶暴动物、眼魔等）。目标只是让对手的战车失去行动能力，而非伤害驾驶者。最后仍能行驶的怪物战车获胜。历史可追溯到许多年前，当时几只大型野生怪物同时闯入城镇。它们因领地争端而互相争斗，而非攻击人类。这给了平民撤离的时间，也让冒险者们得以控制局面。关于其中一只怪物（由于无人能达成一致，每次故事中的英雄怪物都不同）实际上是为了从其他怪物手中拯救城市的矛盾故事流传开来。由于有几只怪物逃脱，据说这只“英雄”怪物仍在外面守护着城市。城市中的人们根据他们认为是守护者的怪物分成不同派系。 War of the Monsters – An Olympic sports like event with many different athletic competitions and games. The main event is a destruction derby style event where groups make “monster wagons”. Essentially people driven/powered wagons/carts that are made to look like monsters of the world (dragons, dire animals, beholders, etc). The goal is just to disable the opponents wagons, not hurt the drivers. Last monster wagon still able to roll wins. History harkens back to a day many many years, when several large wild monsters wandered into town at the same time. They ended up fighting each other rather then attacking the people, in a territorial dispute. This gave the civilians time to evacuate and adventurers time to gain control of the situation. Contradictory stories developed how one monster (it’s always a different one, since no one agrees which it was) was actually there to save the City from the other monsters. As several monsters actually escaped, this “hero” monster is said to still be out there guarding the city. People in the city are split into groups by what monster they believe is their guardian.
25	静默日——连续三天，无人外出或开门。对于初来这座大都市的人来说，这令人十分不安。目睹一座巨型城市完全静止、寂静，显得超现实。几乎无灯无应答。此节日纪念他们在艰难时期因未与任何感染者接触而勉强逃脱瘟疫。 Day of stillness – No-one goes outside or opens doors for 3 days. Very worrying to newcomers to the huge city. It is surreal to see a giant city completely still and silent. Almost no lights and no answers. In remembrance in how they barely escaped the plague by not greeting any infected during those trying times.
26	鹰隼之日——擅长短弓与长弓的射手们比拼技艺与精准度（例如射穿抛掷的铜币大小的物品中心），在马背上击中快速移动的目标。侏儒工匠、铁匠及其他武器匠人从四面八方来到城市，展示他们的新发明与商品。这个节日始于城市还是小村庄时，成年的青年必须证明他们对这种武器的熟练度，作为展示狩猎与保卫社区技能的一部分。 Day of the Hawk – Adepts at the shortbow and longbow compete in a test of skill and accuracy (ex. piercing a thrown copper penny-sized item in the center), hitting fast moving targets from horseback. Gnome artificers, smiths, and other weapons craftsmen travel to the city from far and wide to tout their new inventions and wares. The festival began when the city was a small village and those who came of age had to prove their proficiency with the weapon as part of demonstrating their skills in order to successfully hunt and defend the community.
27	丝带日——每年一度的节日，全镇的柱子上都会系上美丽的丝带。当被问及原因时，人们只会投以肃穆的目光。无人谈论此事，似乎这样做是不敬与冒犯的。 The Day of Ribbons – An annual occasion where beautiful ribbons are tied to posts all over town. When asked why, people only give a somber look. Nobody speaks about it, giving the impression that it’s disrespectful and insulting to do so.
28	燃烧之夜——为纪念击败曾奴役他们的远古黑龙，该镇每年都会宰杀、烹饪并食用一条幼年黑龙。 The Night of Burning – In memory of the defeat of an ancient black dragon that had kept them in slavery, this town has an annual tradition where they kill, cook, and eat a juvenile black dragon.
29	兽人十月节——一年一度的为期一周的庆典，纪念曾围攻城市的庞大兽人军队的失败。大量饮用发酵饮料、跳舞和普遍的公众狂欢。 Orctoberfest – A yearly weeklong celebration commemorating the defeat of a massive army of orcs that had once besieged the city. Lots of drinking of fermented beverages, dancing, and general public revelry.
30	市集日——商贩们提供大量优惠和折扣的日子。它标志着新市场年的开始，庆祝矮人和精灵商品向人类公开交易和销售在全境合法化。 Market’s Day – A day of great deals and bargains from merchants and vendors. It marks the beginning of the new market year and celebrates when the open trading and selling of dwarven and elvish wares to humans was legalized throughout the land.
31	烛光之夜——全城居民手持蜡烛守夜至深夜，随后互赠礼物并举行盛宴庆祝。家人和邻居们成群结队地站在城市各处，高举蜡烛。这一节日纪念了一群冒险者消灭了一窝金龙，解除了农民们被杀害和庄稼被烧毁的恐惧。冒险者们带回龙之财宝与镇民分享，但因暴风雪肆虐，需由成组的火把引导进城。 Candlenights – A night when the entire city holds a candlelight vigil until the dead of night, and then exchanging gifts and celebrating with a feast. Groups of families and neighbors stand around the city in patches, while holding their candles up high. This commemorates the time when a group of adventurers killed a nest of gold dragons, relieving many of the farmers of the fear of being killed and their crops burned. The adventurers brought back the dragon’s hoard to share with the town, but because of a raging blizzard, had to be guided in by groupings of torches.
32	蛇节——一个真正庆祝蛇存在的日子。商贩们出售各种与蛇相关的物品，餐馆提供带有蛇元素的菜肴，人们则在城镇各处放生宠物蛇。这一传统可追溯至城镇曾遭受大规模鼠患之时，情况看似无法好转，直到一位蛇商来到镇上，提出通过繁殖蛇来控制鼠群。鼠患减少后，疾病率下降，整体卫生状况改善，城镇氛围也随之好转。 Day of Snakes – a day literally celebrating the existence of snakes. Vendors sell all kinds of snake-related items, restaurants serve dishes with a bit of snake flair added on, and people release their pet snakes all around town. This goes far back to when there was a large rat pestilence in the town, and it looked like it would never get better until a random snake merchant came to town and offered to begin breeding snakes for them in order to control the population. Disease rates fell, overall cleanliness increased, and the town felt better overall after the rats were driven down to a dwindle.
33	双子祭典——约二十年前，夜空中出现了一对流星。占卜师与星象家预言这将开启一个繁荣的新纪元。人们开始在公共广场上献祭，以吸引“双子”赐福他们的家庭。如今，每年在周年纪念日，人们延续这一传统，于黄昏时分在公共场所点燃两支蜡烛并留下一小块面包蛋糕。 Propitiation of the Twins – around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice “the Twins” to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.
34	推石日——每年这一天，城镇分成两队（东队和西队）。以整个城镇为赛场，他们试图推动一个巨石大小的球（多年前他们意识到真正的巨石对城镇破坏太大）向对方城镇推进。获胜队伍必须将球推入对方城镇的郊区。这是一场友好的竞赛，类似于高中体育对抗赛。作弊或故意伤害他人者会受到同伴的鄙视。城镇坐落在一个U形山谷中，据说是众神在平地上滚动一颗大理石雕刻而成。 Boulder Pushing Day – On this day every year, the town splits into 2 teams (east and west). Using the whole town as a playing field, they attempt to push a boulder sized ball (many years ago they realized that a real boulder caused too much damage to the town)towards the opposite side of town. The winning team must push the ball into the outskirts of the town on the opposing side. It’s a friendly competition akin to a high school sports rivalry. Those who cheat or intentionally hurt others are looked down upon by their peers. The town sits in a u shaped valley that they say the gods carved out by rolling a marble on flat land.
35	灰烬之日——更像是一种仪式而非真正的节日。在这一年的特定日子，镇上的女人们身着白衣，面纱遮面，成群结队地在街上游荡，唱歌跳舞，而男人们则全部穿着黑衣，试图引诱女人们与之交合。女人们被当作女神般对待，接受礼物，并自由选择接受或拒绝伴侣。每位女人都携带着一罐灰烬。在她们找到并选择了心仪的男人后，将灰烬倒在他的衣服上，以示其他女人不要触碰。这一传统源自远古时代，当时火山爆发后，大地被灰烬覆盖，许多人死于最初的喷发或在灾后饿死。为确保该地区古老部落的生存，所有部落的议会制定了繁衍法律。如今，镇上庆祝的是为神和女人们的日子，她们确保了血脉的延续。 The day of Ashes – more of a ritual than a actual holiday. At this specific day of the year, the towns women get dressed in white and their faces are covered behind a veil. They roam the streets in packs singing and dancing, while the men, all dressed in black, try to coerce the women into having intercourse. Women are treated like goddesses, gifts are given to them and they have free choice of taking or refusing a partner. Each woman has a pot filled with ashes with her. After they have found and bedded their man of choice, they empty their pot onto his clothes, so the other women know not to touch them. This tradition comes from ancient times, when after a volcanic eruption the lands were covered with ashes and many people were killed by the initial eruption or starved to death in the aftermath of the event. To ensure the survival of the ancient tribes in this region, the council of all tribes instated the law of reproduction. What the town celebrates today is the day for the gods and the women, who ensure the succession of their lineage.
36	饮品节——很久以前，一小群矮人深入荒野，为帝国的荣耀建立新前哨。他们迅速建起安全据点，食物充足，却很快发现缺少最重要的物资：酒。没有酒，新生的前哨秩序开始瓦解，直到唯一的酿酒师被迫即兴发挥。她别无选择，命令所有人尽可能收集各种水果。收集完毕后，她连续一周不眠不休，用矮人们带来的任何东西酿造酒精，酿出了樱桃酒和梅子酒等奇特饮品。这场酿酒天才的爆发后，焦急等待的矮人们终于品尝到了有生以来最美味的饮品。为纪念此事，如今繁荣的矮人前哨每年举办节日，酿酒师们用当年选定的当地水果竞争酿造最佳饮品。 Festival of the Drink – Long long ago, a small group of dwarfs set out into the wilderness to establish a new outpost for the glory of their empire. When they finally settled down, they were quickly able to establish a secure outpost with plenty of food, but soon they realized they were missing one of the most important supplies of all. Alcohol. Without this necessity, order soon began unraveling in the fledgling outpost, until the lone brewer was forced to improvised. Facing no other choice, she ordered everybody to gather as much of any kind of fruit that they could find. Once the gathering was complete, she worked tirelessly for a week straight to make alcohol out of anything the other dwarfs had brought, churning out such strange brews such as cherry wine and plum cider. At the end of this massive burst of brewing brilliance, the anxiously waiting dwarfs were finally rewarded with the finest tasting drink they had ever tasted in their life. In remembrance, the now flourishing Dwarven outpost celebrates this event in it’s history by holding a festival every year where brewers compete to create the best brew possible from the local fruit chosen for that year.
37	太阳神观测日——全村人在这一天观测太阳神，即尽可能长时间地直视太阳。村民们这样做是因为一位老巫婆告诉他们，这能避免他们目睹村庄的毁灭。由于大家几乎都失明了，她的预言似乎已经成真。 The Sun God Observation Day – On this day all the village observers the sun god. I.e. stare at the sun as long as possible. The people at the village do this because an old witch told them that it would prevent them from seeing the destruction of the village. Since everyone is mostly blind her prophecy seems to have come true.
38	祈愿之夜——城市在码头举行庆典，各行各业的人都被邀请并鼓励相互交流。每个人，无论是独自还是成群，都可以自由创作漂浮花环。午夜时分，当水面平静，城市领袖将涉水释放他们的花环，作为对神明的献礼。随后，众人依次跟随领袖释放花环，之后返回庆典，欢庆常常持续至次日夜晚。此庆典旨在感谢神明赐予的丰收之年，或塑造品格的艰难岁月，悼念在航线上逝去之人，并祈祷他人平安归来。若水面除花环外未被扰动，传说那将是水手们风暴稀少的一年。值得注意的是，这些花环从未在世界其他地方出现，它们完全消失无踪。 Wishmore Night – The city holds a festival at the docks, all walks of life are included and encouraged to mingle with each other. Everyone, either individually or in groups create floating wreaths in whatever way they want to present it. At midnight when the water is still, the leader of the city will wade out into the water and release their wreath first, as an offering to the gods. Everyone in turn will release theirs following the leadership, before returning to the festivities which will often go long into the next night. This celebration is to thank the gods for a bountiful year, or even a year of character building (in case of hard times). It is to mourn those lost in the Shipping routes and to pray for the safe return of others. If the water isn’t disturbed except for the wreaths, it is fabled to be a year of easy storms for the sailors. It is also of note that these wreaths never ever turn up anywhere else in the world. They disappear completely.
39	毁灭庆典——九层地狱对塔拉斯的苏醒如此喜爱，以至于将其定为节日。庆祝活动包括享用这泰坦摧毁的一切，并观看它肆虐整座城市，留下遍地废墟和各类死寂生命。在这庞然巨兽再次沉睡后，所有魔鬼都赞颂塔拉斯的力量与凶猛。 Celebration of Destruction – The Nine Hells love the awakening of the tarrasque so much that they make it a festivity. The celebration comprises of feasting upon whatever the titan destroyed and watching it as it rampages through entire cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dead life of all varieties in its wake. After the gargantuan beast falls asleep once again, all of devil kind praise the strength and ferocity of the powerful tarrasque.
40	麦酒日——矮人庆祝他们最爱的饮品发明的节日，迅速传播至许多其他类人种族。矮人和萨提尔最为喜爱。 Ale Day – A dwarven celebration that simply commemorates the invention of their favorite drink. It quickly spread to many other humanoid peoples. Dwarves and satyrs love it the most.
41	枭熊纪念日——使用枭熊作为防御的精灵城市在这一天向数十年来，有时甚至是数世纪以来保护他们土地的野兽表达感谢。全镇为这些地下的生物提供各种食物。可以说，枭熊们比上面的精灵们更享受这一天。 Owlbear Memorial Day – Elven cities that use owlbears as defense use this day to give thanks to the beasts that have protected their land for decades, sometimes centuries. The whole town offers food of all kinds for the creatures below. It’s very easy to argue that the owlbears enjoy this day more than the elves above ever could.
42	生命庆典——上层界居民庆祝物质界每个生灵中善意的节日。通常在大量善良、中立或无阵营生物诞生时举行，涵盖动物与类人生物。期间会举办一场盛宴，提供世间最美味的食物。 Festival of Life – A celebration of the Upper Planes where the denizens of the heavens celebrate the good in every creature of the Material Plane. Commonly occurs when large amounts of good, neutral, or unaligned creatures are born. This involves animals and humanoids alike. A huge feast is held with some of the most delicious food in existence.
43	艺术日——精灵族庆祝各种艺术形式的节日。在节日前的数月间，物质位面各处的人形生物准备歌曲、戏剧、舞蹈、绘画、雕塑等多种艺术形式。许多萨提尔钟爱这一天，常将其列在麦酒日之后。各族吟游诗人尤其喜爱此节，银龙也乐于与到来的人形生物共庆。 Day of the Arts – An elven celebration where every form of art is honored. For months before this day, humanoids all across the Material Plane prepare songs, plays, dances, paintings, sculptures, and many other forms of art. A favorite day for many satyrs, with many placing it right behind Ale Day in their lists. Bards of many peoples are particularly fond of this festival. Silver dragons also love to celebrate alongside the humanoids that have arrived.
44	眼魔日——由眼魔发明以庆祝自己的节日。它们给自己送礼物，并命令仆人为它们准备礼物，否则仆人们就会丧命。如果有邪教决定崇拜这种漂浮的异怪，眼魔只需提醒其信徒一次，便会收到无数礼物。与每年一次的普通节日不同，眼魔日每周都会举行。 Beholder Day – A holiday invented by beholders to celebrate themselves. They give themselves presents, and demand that their servants get them presents or they die. If a cult has decided to worship the floating aberration, the beholder will only have to remind its worshipers once and it has a myriad of presents coming its way. Unlike normal holidays that occur annually, Beholder Day happens once every week.
45	克利夫顿日——克利夫顿是当地传说中的英雄，很久以前他击败了一只袭击迷雾森林小渔村的恶魔水元素。每年，村民们都会通过举办与他特质相关的比赛来庆祝他的胜利。任何比赛的获胜者都将参与最终竞赛，胜者被授予“克利夫顿化身”称号，并受邀参与一场重现那场著名战斗的仪式。他们会被赋予一套服装和克利夫顿的旧斧头，并被要求击倒一个假人——镇中心早已立着一个恶魔的假人，但假人服装下绑着的是村里的醉汉，他在冒险者不知情的情况下被处死。或许当冒险者靠近假人时，能在村民的欢呼与歌声中听到微弱的呼吸声。如果他们拒绝完成仪式，多年前袭击城镇的水恶魔会从附近的湖中升起，再次威胁摧毁小镇。原来，每年在仪式准备的镇广场上处死一人，是镇压恶魔的仪式的一部分。 Cliffton Day – Cliffton was a local legend who long ago had defeated a demon water elemental which came upon the small fishing village of Mistwood. They celebrate his triumph every year with contests which correlate to what traits he was known for. Whoever wins any of the contests then participates in a final contest, the winner of which is given the title of “Aspect of Cliffton,” and is then invited to participate in a ceremonial recreation of the famous battle. They are given a costume and Cliffton’s old ax and told to strike down an effigy – a standing effigy of the demon is already in center of town, but underneath the rags which make up the costume is a bound man, the village drunk, being put to death without knowledge of the adventurers. Maybe now that the adventurer is close to the figure, they can hear strained breathing amidst the cheers and song of the villagers. If they refuse to complete the ceremony, the same water demon who attacked the town years ago rises from the nearby lake and threatens to destroy the town once again. As it turns out, the killing of a man in the ritually-prepared town square once a year is part of a ritual that keeps the demon at bay.
46	订婚之战——每年夏至后的第一个周末，镇上都会举办一场摔跤锦标赛和表演。来自王国各地的徒手格斗者齐聚小镇，一展身手，同时为非参赛者准备了擂台，用以解决一年来积累的小争执。此节日得名于镇长儿子与一位显赫商人之女婚礼上的一场著名打斗，当时商人、镇长及其大部分家人在长达数小时的混战中拆毁了酒馆、客栈和马厩。 The Betrothment Battle – Every year on the first weekend after the Summer solstice, the town plays host to a wrestling tournament and exhibition. Hand to hand fighters from across the realm come to the town to prove their mettle, and rings are prepared for non-tournament participants to settle small arguments that have built up over the year. Named for a famous fight in the town at the wedding of the Mayor’s son and one of the prominent merchant’s daughters that saw the merchant, the mayor and most of their families tear apart the public house, the tavern, and a stable in an hours long fight.
47	守护者试炼——春季时节，城中精英齐聚一堂，参与一系列体能与智力的较量。挑战形式多样，既有考验心智与精神的复杂仪式、谜题与谜语，也有耐力、敏捷与力量的比拼。投注与夸耀是深受喜爱的环节，而比赛本身则公开进行，民众可为自己支持的选手加油助威。前三名将获授“守护者”荣誉头衔，随后举行庆典，由前任守护者将职责交接给新晋者或继续保留其职位。这些守护者在典礼事务及向王室与市议会表达民众关切或不满方面代表普通民众，直至来年赛事。成为守护者往往是通往行会领导、议会席位乃至王室封爵的途径。试炼与庆典的历史可追溯至城邦时代，当时通过各城邦守护者之间的较量避免了公开战争。复杂的仪式与典礼背后还有着更为黑暗的缘由。如今，这些被视为纯粹的精神与心智锻炼，实则强化着古老符文与法术，以抵御某种始终警觉且饥渴的恐怖存在。 The Wardens Gauntlet – In the spring the city’s best and brightest face each other in a series of physical and mental challenges. Some are complex rituals, puzzles and riddles testing mind and spirit. Others are tests of endurance, agility, and strength. Betting and boasts are a much enjoyed portion and the contests themselves are openly viewed by the public to cheer on their favorites. The top three are given the honorary title of Warden followed by celebration where the previous Wardens hand off the mantle to any new Wardens or retain their station from the previous year. These Wardens represent the common people in matters of ceremony and any concerns or grievances to the Crown and city councils until the next years contest. Being a warden is often the path to guild leaderships or council seats and even titles from the crown. The history behind the trials and celebrations is vaguely remembered from the time of city states when open warfare was avoided by settling issues between the Wardens of each city state. There was also a darker reason for the intricate rituals and ceremony. Now considered just a spiritual and mental exercise, they serve an unknown purpose strengthening ancient Runes and Spells against something truly horrific that is ever vigilant and hungry.
48	刺击日——民众用假匕首庆祝一群盗贼从龙袭中拯救城市的日子。正如你所想，预计会有红色染料污渍。 Stabbing Day – Using fake daggers the populace honors the day a group of rouges saved the city from a dragon attack. It’s exactly what you think, expect red dye stains.
49	罗姆楚克节——当地野蛮人部落在某座不幸的城市聚首，举办一场矮人投掷比赛。使用假胡须的侏儒参赛极为不受欢迎。 Rom’Chuk – Local barbarian tribes meet together in an unfortunate city and hold a Dwarf tossing contest. Use of Gnomes with fake beards is extremely frowned upon.
50	西吉的生日——一位伟大的盾女为拯救城市献出了生命。女性可以通过将心仪之人扛在肩上带走来表达爱意。西吉以直率著称。为纪念她，旅馆房间免费提供。 Siggi’s Birthday – A great shield maiden gave her life to save the city. Women can let anyone they are sweet on know by picking them up over their shoulders and hauling them off. Siggi wasn’t known for her subtlety. Rooms at the Inn are free in her honor.
51	竞技周——为期一周的庆典，包含阳光下所有类型的游戏；从敏捷测试如障碍赛，到力量比拼如掷木比赛，甚至还有学术色彩，如法师对决。这个欢乐周起源于很久以前，当时一个暴君以铁腕统治城市。每年他都会强迫臣民参加疯狂的游戏，通常以他们的死亡告终。他被推翻后，市民们决定保留这个庆典周，但去掉了“死亡”部分。这帮助社区更加团结，将那些怀有可怕野心的人排除在外。 The Games – A week of festivities that include games of all types under the sun; from dexterity-tests like obstacle courses, to strength competitions such as log-tossing, and even an academia note to it, like a spellcaster’s competition. This week of fun was created some time ago when a tyrant ran the city with an iron fist. Once a year he would force his supplicants to participate in crazy games which usually ended in their death. Once he was overthrown, the citizens opted to keep the week of festivities, whilst removing the “death” part. It helped the community grow closer, keeping those with terrible ambitions out.
52	朝圣日——这一天，城市中的每个人都需“承担自己的重担”，将内心最深处的痛苦公之于众，以便邻居、朋友和社区能够真诚地给予支持。拒绝参与的人将被逐出社区，直到他们完成前往邻近大陆的朝圣之旅，并带回能积极改善社区的东西，无论是金钱、食物还是魔法防护。这一习俗源自城市尚为雏形小镇时，那时每个人都需尽己所能，彼此依赖，共同扶持。 The Pilgrimage – A day when every person in the city is expected to “carry their weight” and bring their greatest distress out in the open, so that their neighbors, friends and community may support them in earnest. Those who refuse to participate are exiled from the community until they complete a pilgrimage to the neighboring continent and bring back something that will actively make their community better; be it money, food, or magical wards. This is a practice from when the city was still just a fledgling town and every person needed to pull their own weight, and everyone relied on everyone else to support each other.
53	彩票日——一种祈求作物丰收的仪式，鼓励外来者参与。日落时分，有人被选中并被众人用石头砸死。不要接受他们提供的抽奖券……但之后会有奖品。 Lottery Day – A crop fertility ritual where outsiders are encouraged to attend. Eventually someone is picked at sundown and stoned to death by the crowd. Do not take the raffle tickets they offer…but there are prizes afterwards.
54	角日——仪式吸引着提夫林，如同飞蛾扑火。他们几乎被古老黑曜石提夫林头骨号角在音乐中的低沉嗡鸣所催眠。黄昏时分，节日达到高潮，所有古代战斗的灵魂附身于狂欢者，向他们展示了一场古老战役，其中一支提夫林队伍反抗了他们的恶魔主人，与镇民联手将恶魔赶回地狱。领袖无私地献出生命，通过吹响号角在不超过十五个恶魔的胸膛上烧出一个洞，拯救了她的战友和新朋友……只留下她的头骨。“我们铭记”是口号，之后提夫林们受到感谢与照顾，人们心中想着“我们可以超越自身的局限”。 Day of the Horn – the ceremony draws in tieflings like moths to a flame. Almost hypnotized by the low droll of an ancient obsidian tiefling skull horn being played amongst the music. Dusk brings the climax of the festival where all the spirits of an ancient battle posses the revelers and show them an ancient battle where a contingent of tieflings rebelled against their fiend masters and joined with the townsfolk to drive the demons back to Hell. The leader selflessly gave her life to save her comrades and new friends by blowing a smoldering hole through the chests of no more than 15 fiends…leaving just her skull. “We Remember” is the mantra and afterwards the tieflings are thanked and cared for with the thought “We can be more than the sum of our parts”.
55	马德尔星陨日——一颗陨石坠落形成陨石坑，最终在此建起了一座城镇。这块五米高的岩石能吸收所有敌对魔法并窃取幻象。其舒缓的律动光芒令人叹为观止。仅有少数长者拥有由陨石打造的金属手环，使他们能在镇内施法。每百年仅颁发一枚新手环。在镇内，手环允许施法；在镇外，则有几率吸收敌对魔法（甚至包括自己的）。此石特性还会严重干扰任何接触它的战构体。 Madel’s Star Day – A meteorite fell to form a crater where a town eventually sprang up. The 5 meter rock absorbs all hostile magic and steals any illusions. The soothing rhythmic glow is amazing to behold. Only a handful of elders have metal bracelets fashioned from the meteorite that allows them to cast spells in town. Only one new one is awarded every century. In town it allows for casting of spells, outside of town it has a chance to absorb a hostile one (even your own). The properties of the stone also royally mess with any Warforged that come into contact with it.
56	灰雪日——该地区的火山活动不稳定，揭露了一座被毁的恶魔城市。挖掘中发现了古代面具，派对参与者佩戴这些面具。面具的不稳定性质在日落后赋予有限的火焰操控能力。每年，派对人群都会逐渐被一种模糊的附身形式所腐化。 Grey Snow Day – A volcanic instability in the area uncovered a ruined fiend city. Excavations uncovered ancient masks that the party goers wear. The volatile nature of the masks grant a limited form of fire manipulation after sun down. The party notices that a vague form of possession is slowly corrupting the crowd every year.
57	福玛拉日——人们佩戴月桂和橡木花环，为附近永久德鲁伊林地中的四位树人守护者准备供品。一群山丘巨人正欲摧毁一群农夫时，一位德鲁伊及其同伴将他们击退。德鲁伊留下一年确保法术生效。树人实际上喜爱镇民，并吸引了其他和平的有意识植物。 Fomarath Day – Laurel and oak wreaths are adorned and offerings prepared for the four treefolk guardians in a nearby permanent druid grove. A group of Hill Giants were about to lay waste to a group of farmers when a druid and his party drove them off. The druid stayed behind for a year to make sure the spell would stick. The treefolk actually love the townsfolk and have attracted other peaceful sentient plants.
58	克雷格胡夫集会——一群游牧的半人马与附近的半身人定居点有着极为交织的历史，曾有一位祖先拯救了另一位，或一方在入侵中拯救了另一方。成员能做的最崇高之事便是彼此宣誓，共同骑行一年零一天，守护这片领地。现场供应的优质酒精和蜂蜜酒数量惊人。观看涂着战妆的半身人与戴着草帽、穿着背心的半人马，场面颇为滑稽。 Craghoof Moot – A nomadic band of centaurs and a nearby halfling settlement have a very intertwined history of one ancestor saving another or one group saving the other from invasion. The most noble thing a member could do is swear an oath to one another to ride together for a year and a day protecting the territory. The amount of high grade alcohol and mead available is mind boggling. Watching halflings in war paint and centaurs in straw hats and vests is quite hilarious.
59	德鲁伊链节——作为抵御异界入侵的最后防线，三位德鲁伊、十二元素生物与三头巨龙可联合施展名为“盖亚之链”的原始仪式，将威胁所有存在的恐怖拖入星球之口，永久囚禁于熔岩核心之中。此仪式牺牲所有参与者，故三座神殿遗址成为众生敬仰的圣地。每年一度，巨大的灵魂水晶会映现这些逝去英雄的影像，铭记初代元素之怒与力量，正是它们拯救了世界。 The Druid Chain festival – As a last ditch protection against incursions into this dimension three druids, twelve elementals, and three dragons can unite and merge for a primordial ritual called a Gaia Chain to drag whatever horror that threatens all existence into the maw of the planet itself trapping it within the molten core for all eternity. It kills all those involved and as such the three temple locations became holy places to all forms of life. It is the raw elemental fury and power of the first ones that saved the world are remembered in giant soul crystals that once a year show the images of these lost heroes.
60	破碎玩具日——战争构装体纪念其独立的节日。 Broken Toy Day – Warforged holiday marking their Independence.
61	大混乱纪念日——纪念野蛮人、兽人和哥布林部落彻底摧毁一座由死灵法师、术士和巫师组成的城市的那一天。 The Anniversary of The Great Mayhem – Recalls the day tribe of barbarians, orcs, and goblins laid absolute waste to a city of necromancers, warlocks, and wizards.
62	鳗鱼节——每年秋天，当当地水库中的鳗鱼数量过多时，天鹅女会邀请附近村庄的居民前来捕捞，为来年储备鳗鱼。虽然新鲜的鳗鱼是节日的主角，但节日本身却是一项社区活动，包括腌制鳗鱼、提炼鳗鱼油等，确保所需物资能保存到来年。镇广场上摆满了大长桌，当地人早早聚集，争抢最中心的位置，那里流言与麦酒最为丰盛。 Eeling – every autumn as the eel population in the local reservoir grows too great, the Swanmay invite the local village to come and collect as many as they can stock for the year. While fresh eel is on the menu, the festival itself is a community occupation, jarring eels, processing oil from them and otherwise making sure that what they want will keep until next year. Large communal tables are set up in the town square and the locals gather early to get a place at the centre most tables where gossip and ale flow strongest.
63	挖掘高峰——在夏至时分，该地区的各矮人家族齐聚“亲缘矿坑”，在为期三天的节日里共同开采。矿坑本身已无珍贵矿物，但关于家族祖先预言其完工将为所有矮人族带来巨大财富的传说仍流传不息。尽管矮人们尽情欢乐，外来者的出现却会立即扫兴。 Digging High – At summer solstice the various dwarven families of the area come to The Kin Hole, where they will mine as one for the three days of the festival. The hole itself is barren of valuable minerals, but the myth that the families’ ancestors divined great wealth for all dwarven kind at its completion still exists. While much merriment is made by the dwarves, the presence of outsiders is an immediate dampener.
64	饕餮节——虽非严格意义上的节日，但每年头两个月总是被波特里的半身人热切期待。富裕家庭在此期间举办奢华宴会的传统，作为一种拉票手段，已取代了原本松散的精英治理，转变为一种极为狂热的酒神统治。 Gluttony – though not a festival per se, the first two months of the year are always eagerly anticipated by the hobbi… the halflingses of Portree. The tradition of the wealthier houses organising lavish bashes during the time as a means of canvassing has replaced a very loose sense of meritocratic governance with a very enthusiastic intoxicracy.
65	寂静节——昔日，佩尔蒂夫村处境极为险恶。早期定居者聚集耕作，后来才意识到该地区受到兽人、枭熊及地下更黑暗生物的威胁。尽管春季人们热烈庆祝那些拯救村庄的英雄，但深秋时节，村民们通过默默共饮来铭记那段恐惧与救赎的岁月。除必要且简短的交流外，任何言语皆被轻视，村中仍有老者能自童年忆起那段时光。 The Quiet – in the old days, the village of Pertiv was in a most precarious position. Early settlers had grouped to farm an area which they only later realised was threatened by orcs, owlbears and darker things from below. While everyone celebrates the heroes who saved the village all those years ago rambunctiously in Spring, in late autumn the people remember the early days of fear and salvation by drinking heavily together in silence. Any but the most necessary and cursory communication is looked down on, and there are those in the village old enough to remember those times from their childhood.
66	火祭——焚烧冬之女巫。传说冬之女巫（即冬季的精灵）沉闷阴郁，但可以通过欢笑与欢乐将其驱赶。村民们通过搭建篝火来庆祝，一旦太阳触及地平线，篝火便被点燃。他们饮用热葡萄酒，在雪中嬉戏，并唱着粗俗的歌曲以驱赶冬之女巫。 Fyre – The burning of the Winter Witch. They say that the Winter Witch (who is the spirit of winter) is dull and dreary, but can be driven away with humor and merriment. Villagers celebrate by erecting bonfires and once the sun touches the horizon they are set alight. They drink mulled wine, play games in the snow and sing crude songs to drive the Winter Witch away.
67	格林——兽人初血仪式。在兽人中，未经历血祭者被视为孩童，较为文明的兽人部落在名为格林的节日中举行此仪式。被认为有资格或敢于尝试的兽人会组成战团或突袭队，通常选择小型的狗头人巢穴或地精前哨作为目标。所有参与者必须为格鲁姆什（他们的神）带回一颗心脏，并带回一颗头颅以证明其勇武。 Grimm – Orcish first blood ritual. An orc is a child until they are blooded, among the more civilized tribes of orcs this takes place in a festival called Grimm. Those deemed worthy or are brazen enough to try form a Wog or raiding party then a suitable target is chosen usually small Kobold warren or goblin outpost. All participants must bring back a heart for Grummush (their god) and a head to prove their prowess.
68	春假巫师破坏大赛——一个受欢迎的海滨小镇被附近几所大型学校的数百至数千名放假的学生和学徒巫师涌入。这些巫师不可避免地结成狂欢团体，喝得烂醉，然后试图展示他们的法术来恐吓对手学校、吸引潜在约会对象或单纯制造混乱。为了将巫师们挡在城镇之外并转移破坏，小镇在沙滩上搭建了啤酒花园、洗手间、廉价“旅馆”及其他牺牲性设施。学生巫师们自然将摧毁所有临时建筑作为目标，最终在最后一晚上演一场大规模破坏大赛。与此同时，镇民们瑟瑟发抖，希望派出的军队能阻止他们再次入侵并烧毁小镇。 Spring Break Wizard Demolition Derby – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice wizards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The wizards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to show off their spells to intimidate rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply cause chaos. In order to keep the wizards out of town proper and redirect the damage, the town sets up beer gardens, bathrooms, dirt cheap “inns”, and other sacrificial establishments on the beach. The student wizards naturally make it their goal to destroy absolutely every temporary structure they can, culminating in a massive destruction derby on the final night. Meanwhile, the city residents cower and hope the dispatched army can keep them from invading and burning down the town, again.
69	春假剧作家锦标赛——一个受欢迎的海滨小镇被附近几所大型学校数百至数千名放假的学生和学徒吟游诗人涌入。这些诗人不可避免地组成狂欢团体，喝得酩酊大醉，然后试图超越对手学校的表演，吸引潜在约会对象，或仅仅为了出名。为了利用他们的创意产出并增加旅游业，小镇在沙滩上搭建了临时剧院。学生诗人自然以吸引最多观众为目标。学生们在多个不同类别中创作原创作品，包括行进乐队、全管弦乐队、历史剧、悲剧歌剧、喜剧音乐剧、舞蹈等，并与来自各校的对手团体正面交锋。赢得最多观众的一方获胜。在最后一晚，所有学生诗人齐聚一堂，进行通宵即兴演奏。那些不在观看演出的市民因在演出期间过度饮酒而醉倒。（免费酒精常被用来吸引观众。） Spring Break Playwright Championship – A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice bards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The bards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to outdo the acts of rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply make a name for themselves. In order capitalize on their creative output and increase tourism, the town builds temporary theaters on the beach. The student bards naturally make it their goal to claim the most audience. Students create original productions in several different categories, marching band, full orchestra, historical drama, tragic opera, comedy musical, dance, etc. and debut them head to head against rival groups from all the different schools.
