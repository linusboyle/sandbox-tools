1d100	风味-森林景致
1	一棵覆盖着弯曲便士的树桩。看起来过路人将便士和其他小硬币的边缘塞进了这个大树桩的裂缝和树皮中，并将它们弯曲下来，在树皮上创造出几乎鳞片般的效果。多年后，树皮空间用尽，便士被塞在其他便士之间，如此反复，逐渐使树桩增大。 A tree stump covered in bent pennies. It looks like passers by have jammed the edges of pennies and other small coins into the cracks and bark of this large stump and bent them down to create an almost scale-effect on the bark. Over the years after the bark space ran out pennies were jammed between other pennies, and so on, growing the stump over time.
2	此处的小径已被替换为光滑的石板，与裸露的土地、草地和野花交替排列，形成棋盘图案。整个图案在边缘处不规则，比真正的棋盘更长但更窄。 The path here has been replaced with smooth stone squares alternating with squares of bare earth, grass and wildflowers in a checkerboard pattern. The whole pattern is irregular at the edges, longer but thinner than a true checkerboard.
3	小径周围挂满了各式各样的灯和灯笼，有的挂在路旁的树枝上或铁杆上，有的从上方垂下，有的直接放在地上。没有两盏灯是相同的，有的是铁的，有的是木的，有的是纸的，有的华丽，有的精致，有的精灵风格，有的矮人风格。夜晚时它们都会自行点亮，在日落时分以无法辨认的顺序闪烁开启。 A vast collection of lamps and lanterns have been hung around the path, some along the sides in tree branches or hung from iron rods, some hanging down from above, some placed directly on the ground. No two lamps are the same, some are iron, some wood, some paper, some ornate, some elaborate, some elven, some dwarven. At night they all illuminate on their own, flicking on over the course of the sunset, in no discernible pattern.
4	这条小径旁有几棵树被砍倒，留下的树桩被挖空并种上了当地的野花和草药。其中一些树桩中央放置了一个大南瓜，藤蔓缠绕在根部周围。 Several trees have been cut down along this trail, and their left behind stumps have been hollowed out and planted with local wildflowers and herbs. A few of them boast a single large pumpkin placed right at the stump's center with vines curled all around the roots.
5	小径拓宽成一个圆形空地，中央有一座高台喷泉，水面如镜般平滑，随后从边缘倾泻而下。水中漂浮着一颗清澈的凝视球，缓缓旋转。 The path widens out into a circular clearing. At the center a raised dais fountain pours with mirror-smooth water before cascading over the edge. The water supports a single clear gazing ball, gently rotating.
6	这里的树木和植物都被小标签或精致的书法标记所标注。标签上注明了植物的名称和一些常见用途。这些标签有助于任何想要提高采集技能的人，为接下来一周的采集检定提供1D4的加值。 The trees and plants here have all been tagged or marked with small signs, in delicate calligraphy. The signs name the plants and list some common uses. The signs help anyone who is looking to improve their foraging, granting a 1D4 bonus to foraging rolls for the next week.
7	小径与一条平静的河流交汇，河岸边漂浮着一块约10英尺宽的扁平石盘。河水使石盘旋转，但它被一块突出的岩石卡住。随着河水推动石盘旋转，石盘不断磨削卡住的岩石。显然，它已在此多年，因为被卡住的岩石上已因旋转形成了一个明显的凹坑。 The path intersects with a calm river where a flat disc of stone, about 10' across, is floating at the water's edge. The river is causing the stone to rotate but it is caught in place by an outcrop of rock. As the river rotates the stone disc the disc grinds out more of the rock it has caught on. It has clearly been here for years as the stone it is stuck on has a sizable divot formed from the rotation.
8	小径旁枝头可见一座长满青苔的小屋，由红松木搭建，屋顶铺着森林绿的瓦片。屋顶呈尖峭的尖顶状，上有一盏点亮的铜灯。小屋看起来小得难以住人，或许仅够避雨。屋内墙壁上绘有该地区的详细地图。入口旁的箱子里可找到供两人食用的一日口粮。 A small mossy cottage can be seen of a branch in the trail. The cottage is made of red pine with forest green roof tiles. It's roof is a sharp steeple with a lit coppola. The cottage looks too small for anyone to really live in, perhaps enough space to keep out of any passing rain. Inside the walls of the house are completely painted with a detailed map of the area. A day's ration for two people can be found in a chest by the entrance.
9	你偶然发现一张由橡木制成的隐蔽长椅，上方有高大的棚架支撑着茂密的藤蔓。长椅后方的棚架上切割出一个圆形框架，完美地框住了西边田野中一棵巨大的橡树。 You happen across a sheltered bench made of oak with a tall trellis supporting dense vines. There is a circle frame cut from the trellis at the back of the bench which perfectly frames a massive oak tree growing in a field to the west.
10	远处望去，这棵树仿佛在地面上散发出明亮而炽热的能量。近看发现有人将森林的落叶围绕一棵巨大的核桃树排列，黄色的叶子最靠近树干，然后是橙色，最后是红色，形成一种向外辐射的图案，营造出这种效果。 From a distance it looks like this tree is radiating a bright and fiery energy along the ground. On closer inspection someone has taken the fallen leaves of the forest and arranged them around the base of a massive walnut tree so that the yellow ones are nearest to the trunk, then orange, then red, radiating out in a pattern to create the effect.
11	这条小径上散落着几扇木框玻璃窗，有的倚靠在树上，有的平躺在地面。 Several glass windows in wooden frames have been scattered around this path, leaned against trees and laying on the ground.
12	此处小径蜿蜒而下，穿过一片被苔藓和蕨类植物密集覆盖的岩石露头。随着路径下行，两侧巨石耸立，虽触手可及却高耸入云。在路径最低处，一座木桥曲折穿行于两块布满苔藓的巨石之间，桥栏以扇形排列的原木构成。苔藓上的水滴落在过桥者身上。桥下是条细窄的小溪，过桥后小径再度向上攀升。 The path here dips down between an outcrop of stone that is densely covered in mosses and ferns. As the trail moves down, the stones raise up, towering far overhead yet still close enough to touch. At the nadir of the path a wooden bridge zigzags through two massive mossy stones. The railings of the bridge have wooden logs arranged in a fan pattern. Water drips down from the moss onto the passers of the bridge. The bridge crosses a skinny creek before the path slopes upwards again.
13	小径偶遇一道由松散石块垒成的矮墙。墙虽不高易翻越，但路径仅沿墙一侧延伸。行不多时，可见一座石砌月洞门，路径穿门而过，继续向前延伸。 The path happens upon a low wall made of loose stones. The wall is easy enough to hop over, but the path follows along only one side of the wall. After a few minutes of walking, a stone arched Moon Gate has been made, which the path follows through and continues onward.
14	你遇到一块竖立在草丛中的长方形石头。在其底部，其他长方形石头以放射状的太阳图案摆放在地面上，全部指向竖立的石头。随着路径延伸，可以看到另外两座这样的石雕，其中一座距离路径很远。 You come upon an oblong stone propped up vertically in the grasses. At its base, other oblong stones have been placed on the ground in a radiating sun pattern, all pointing toward the vertical stone. As the path progresses two more of these sculptures can be seen, though one of them was a great distance away from the path.
15	有人在这段路径上搭建了格子屋顶，紫藤从中生长，垂挂着芬芳的紫色花朵。方形矮灯笼悬挂在花朵之间，但并未点亮。 Someone has built a lattice roof to cover this section of path. From it wisteria grows, hanging down fragrant purple flowers overhead. Squat square lanterns have been hung in between the flowers, but they are unlit.
16	一棵巨大的红杉树底部被幻象蝴蝶装饰，蝴蝶翅膀呈虹彩紫色。它们成群结队地在树皮上飞舞，几乎遮住了整片树皮。蝴蝶仅覆盖部分区域，形成小径般的蝴蝶群沿着树干向上飞舞。 The base of a massive sequoia tree has been decorated with illusory butterflies, with iridescent purple wings. The butterflies are fluttering while clumped all over the bark of the tree so that the bark cannot even be seen. They only cover it in patches, with small trails of fluttering butterflies reaching up the tree trunk.
17	小径两旁悬挂着铸铁鸟笼，笼门全部敞开，内部生长着各种不同类型的植物。 The path has been lined with hanging wrought iron birdcages. The cage doors are all open and plants are growing inside, of all different types.
18	森林小径周围散布着完全透明的玻璃蘑菇，几乎难以察觉，唯有它们对土壤的奇异扭曲才显露出其存在。 Perfectly clear glass mushrooms have been placed throughout the forest around the trail, almost imperceptible but for their odd distortions of the soil.
19	小径旁悬挂着数盏灯笼，均由下垂的蓝色叶片或花瓣制成，柔和的光芒被包裹在叶束之中。叶片用黑铁缠绕，并制成钩状，便于从上方悬挂。 Several lanterns have been hung along the trail here. All of them are made of downward drooping blue leaves or flower petals, with the gently hovering lights trapped within the bundle of leaves. The leaves are wrapped with black iron which is then formed into a hook so the lanterns can be easily hung from above.
20	小径及森林各处放置了几根原木，原木上有裂缝，裂缝中填满了透明树脂。夜晚时分，树脂发出明亮光芒，照亮道路。 Several logs have been placed along the trail as well as throughout the forest. The logs are cracked and the cracks have been refilled with clear resin. At night the resin glows brightly, lighting the way.
21	在茂密的森林中，有人搭建了一座简易的木屋框架，没有墙壁和屋顶。屋中央悬挂着一盏点燃的枝形吊灯，摆放着一张可容纳八人的精美桃花心木餐桌，餐具齐全。随着时间的推移，桌子、盘子和吊灯都已磨损，布满裂纹和污垢。 In the dense forest someone has made a simple wooden frame of a house, with no walls or roof. At the center of the house they have hung a lit chandelier, and placed a lovely mahogany table with seating for eight, and a full place setting. The table, plates and chandler have become worn over time, cracked and dirty.
22	在这条小径上，有人从地上收集了树枝和细枝，然后将它们编织成八个蛋形拱门，正好安置在路径上方。这些拱门约7英尺高，可以轻松通过。 Along this trail someone has gathered up sticks and twigs from the ground. Then, they wove the sticks together to make eight egg-shaped arches placed right over the path. The arches are about 7 feet tall, and can easily be passed through.
23	小径绕过山丘，俯瞰一片广阔田野，田野中矗立着一座石制的阶梯状塔楼废墟。塔楼风化严重，摇摇欲坠，内部空无一物，但景象令人印象深刻。 The path rounds a hill and overlook a huge field, in the field a stepped tower ruin made of stone juts up. The tower is weathered and crumbling, and nothing can be found inside, but the sight is impressive.
24	小径穿过一片草原，蜿蜒而上至陡峭的山坡，最终通向石阶。有人用与台阶相同材料的剩余石板，以垂直或奇特的角度摆放，装饰着这条小径。 The path leads up through a grassy steppe and up through a steep hillside. The path gives way to stone stairs. Someone has come through and taken surplus stone slabs of the same material as the staircase and placed them vertically or at odd angles to decorate the trail.
25	一座小型大理石圆形大厅建在河边，可舒适地容纳三人，但由于屋顶为铁格结构，无法提供遮蔽。大厅中央有一座小雕像，是一只猫骄傲地叼着一条鱼。 A small marble rotunda has been built at the edge of a river. It seats three comfortably but offers no shelter as the roof is made of latticed iron. At the center of the rotunda is a small statue of a cat holding a fish in its mouth proudly.
26	小径与另一条路交汇，但并未直接相连，而是从一座大桥下穿过。桥底有人用不同颜色的河石装饰天花板，宛如晴朗的夜空，其中几颗著名的星座清晰可见。 The path crosses another, but does not directly connect as it goes under a large bridge. On the underside of the bridge someone has taken differently colored river stones and attached them to the ceiling to look like a clear night sky. Several well known constellations can be seen in their work.
27	小径未铺砌，且略显荒芜，但偶然间你遇到一段短而宽的阶梯，其气派足以匹配任何国王。阶梯共十级，宽度可容五人并行，两侧是宽阔的大理石扶手，雕刻着植物和森林生物的图案。虽有人曾来此，挖走了所有宝石眼睛和阶梯上的金箔，但精美的石雕依旧留存。阶梯通往小径的更高处，路径继续如常延伸。 The path is unpaved, and generally unkempt, but you happen upon a short wide staircase, regal enough for any king. The staircase is 10 steps tall and wide enough for 5. It boasts a wide stone banister carved of marble. Carvings of plants and forest creatures decorate the sides. Someone has come through and pried all the gems from their eyes and the gold plating from the staircase in general, but the impressive stonework remains. The staircase connects to a higher portion of the path, which continues on as normal.
28	小径开始陡峭，粗糙的台阶引领前行。道路突现急转弯，弯道内侧矗立着一尊精心雕刻的女子雕像，怀中抱着一只狐狸。雕像四周点燃了数支蜡烛。 The path begins to steepen, with roughly formed stairs leading the way. The trail takes a sharp hairpin bend to proceed. At the inner bend of their hairpin is a carefully carved statue of a woman, holding a fox in her arms. Several candles have been lit and placed all over the statue.
29	一把粗糙的梯子通向灌木丛顶部的一团树枝，看起来几乎像一个巨大的鸟巢。只有爬上梯子才能看到内部，里面是一个有遮蔽的软垫床，可以舒适地容纳两人。 A roughly hewn ladder leads up into a whirl of sticks sitting atop a thicket. It looks almost like a massive birds nest. The inside can not be seen until you climb the ladder. Inside is a sheltered padded bed that will fit two comfortably.
30	小径径直穿过一棵巨大的树木，树根形成了一组阶梯，通向一个由树皮构成的开放拱门，将树木一分为二。拱门内部，许多过路者留下了涂鸦。 The path passes directly through a huge tree. A set of stairs have been formed from the tree roots leading up to an open archway of bark that bisects the tree. Inside the archway many passers by have left behind graffiti.
31	三棵细长的树木沿着小径精心培育生长，它们从共同的根部分叉展开，支撑着一块约5英尺宽的石制桌面。随后它们向内生长，在桌面上方形成三重拱门，最终在顶端重新结合，并以自然树形展开枝叶。桌面空无一物。 Three skinny trees have been carefully grown along the side of the path. They split from a common root and widen out to support a stone table top about 5' across. Then they grow back inward, making a triple arch over the table, before recombining at the apex and finally leafing out in a natural tree formation. The table is clear.
32	这条小径旁的围栏由活树构成，树干以编织的方式生长在一起。围栏顶端的树木长出鲜绿的叶子。围栏之外，是一片开阔的草原。 The fencing along the side of this trail is made up of live trees, grown in such a way that they weave their trunks together. At the top of these fences the trees sprout with bright green leaves. Beyond the fence, open prairie.
33	小径变得绿草如茵，维护良好，树木修剪得整整齐齐。在这片精心雕琢的森林中行走约一英里后，树木逐渐让位给一片开阔的空地，中央矗立着一座木制凉亭，亭上鲜花盛开。凉亭四周摆放着长椅，足以容纳大批观众。 The path becomes grassy and well maintained, and the trees become neatly trimmed. After a mile or so of this pristine artful forest the trees give way to an open clearing with a single wooden gazebo at the center, covered in flowers in full bloom. Benches all around the gazebo have been placed to support a large audience.
34	小径沿着一条岩石溪流蜿蜒，溪水清澈。半英里后，发现溪流的源头，水流从一只巨大的石雕手掌中涌出。石手轻轻将水倾注在一棵幼小的树上。手掌和溪水周围的石头上长满了厚厚的苔藓。 The path leads along a rocky creek, flowing with crisp water. After half a mile the source of the creek is found, flowing from the palm of a massive hand carved of stone. The Hand gently tips the water on top of a single juvenile tree. The stones all around the hand and water are thick with mosses.
35	路旁的一棵树生长出了一种不自然的形态。树干分裂成数根枝条，最外层的形成一个菱形，内层的枝条则相互交织，形成一个个“洞”。这些枝条在菱形图案之后重新合并成树干，而树的其余部分看起来正常。 A tree along the side of the path has been grown into an unnatural pattern. The trunk has split into several branches, the outermost forming a diamond shape, and the inner ones forming 'holes' around on another in a sort of weaving pattern. The branches all recombine to form the trunk after the diamond pattern and the rest of the tree appears to be normal.
36	小径蜿蜒绕过一棵巨大的白色紫藤树，黑色的枝干盘曲，白色花朵如溪流般灿烂。花瓣沿着小径轻轻飘落。 The path curves around the base of a massive white wisteria tree, with dark black winding branches and brilliant streams of white flowers. Petals are gently raining all along the trail.
37	小径变成了一长串由树干雕刻而成的木盘，首尾相连，延伸至少一英里。 The path gives way to a long line of wooden discs carved from tree trunks, lined end to end for at least a mile of trail.
38	有人用树枝在悬垂于小径的树上挂了一个五角星，并在星星的每个角上绑了不同的干燥草药束。 Someone has hung a pentagram made of sticks from a tree overhanging the path, and tied each point in the star with a different bundle of drying herbs.
39	小径蜿蜒经过一处瀑布，随后切入石崖。在阶梯开始之前，石制平台被雕刻成一个观赏瀑布的美丽观景点，配有矮人雕刻的栏杆。 The trail curves past a waterfall before cutting up through a stone cliff. Right before the staircase begins the stone landing has been carved into a beautiful viewing point for the falls, with dwarven cut banisters.
40	下一段路径清晰可见，但接近它的人却强烈想要避开，对森林的惊叹与对路径的烦躁交织。没有法术强制人离开小径，仅是一种暗示。路旁两侧的牌子上写着“少有人走的路”——凯文·皮科特。多媒体；森林，附魔。 The next section of path is clearly marked, and yet anyone approaching it has the strong urge to avoid the path, feeling a mix of wonder at the forest and annoyance at the path. There is no spell forcing anyone off the trail, merely a suggestion. A plaque laid out off the trail on either side reads 'The road less traveled' Kevyn Picot. Multimedia; Forest, enchantment.
41	小径接近一方池塘。池塘外沿呈完美正方形，小径通过一系列覆盖苔藓的粗糙石头上方，以曲线形式跨越池塘。小径上每隔一段距离便分出紧密的石头螺旋。池塘水面平静，清澈的水中可见几条锦鲤游弋。 The path approaches a pond. The pond is perfectly square around the outside, and the path moves over the pond, on a series of rough laid stones covered in mosses, in a curved pattern. Branching off the path at regular intervals are tight spirals of stone. The pond is smooth and several Koi fish can be seen swimming in the clear water.
42	当你接近这段小径时，可以看到一个闪烁的人形生物站在一棵树旁，礼貌地微笑。当你足够靠近时，这个穿着剪裁得体的三件套西装的年轻人会提供一次导览。如果你接受导览，他会讲述数百年前在这片森林中发生的一场历史性战役，当时这片土地在精灵和一支半人马氏族之间争夺。如果你拒绝，人形生物会祝你顺利，然后继续礼貌地微笑。 As you approach this section of trail a shimmering humanoid can be seen standing by a tree, smiling politely. When you are close enough the human figure - a young man wearing a well tailored three piece suit - offers a tour. If you take the tour, he will tell about a historical battle fought in this very forest hundreds of years ago when the land was contested between elves and a clan of centaur. If you decline, the humanoid wishes you well and goes back to smiling politely.
43	最近下过雨，地面潮湿泥泞。继续前行时，你们发现一副散落在森林中的扑克牌，有的在路面上，有的挂在树上，有的半埋在土里，但所有牌都干净如新。如果队伍设法收集了所有牌，它们会立即从持有者手中再次散落，遍布整个森林。 It has rained recently, the ground is wet and muddy. As you continue on you come upon a deck of cards that has been scattered through the forest, some cards in the trail, some in trees, some half buried, but all of them are clean and pristine. If the party manages to gather all the cards, they immediately re-scatter from the holder's hand, all over the forest once again.
44	森林小径旁几码处，一棵孤树闪烁着折射的光芒。细看之下，整棵树似乎是由一块巨大的深蓝色碧玺雕刻而成。 A single tree in the forest, a few yards off from the trail, shimmers with refracted light. On closer inspection the whole tree appears to have been carved from a massive deep blue tourmaline.
45	有人在小径旁放置了里程标记，是当地大石块上精心雕刻的矮人数字。然而，它们间距不均，似乎完全无法准确反映距离。 Someone has put down mile markers along the trail, big slabs of local stone with carefully carved dwarven numbers. They are not evenly spaced though, and don't seem to accurately reflect distance at all.
46	一只狐狸在阳光照耀的岩石上休息。小径在岩石处分成两条绕过，然后在另一侧重新汇合。 A fox is resting on top of a sunny rock. The trail splits in two to go around the rock and then recombines on the other side.
47	小径开始沿着一条低缓平静的小溪延伸，溪底铺着平坦的石头。水深仅及小腿，涉水而行令人心旷神怡。然而，溪床不时出现深达20码以上的圆形石洞，完美无缺。 The trail has begun to run alongside a low, calm creek with flat stones at the bottom. The water is only about calf-high. Walking in the water is soothing and invigorating. However every so often the creek bed is marred with deep (20+ yard) stone holes, perfectly circular.
48	旅途开始时还是荒野的森林，现在除了桦树（柳树、枫树等）外，所有树木都被清除，地上也没有落叶。你看不到任何树桩。通过自然检定（10或更高），你会发现许多地方被新土填平。仔细观察会发现，这片森林小径与地图略有偏差，但在桦树林尽头重新与预期的小径汇合。 The forest which was wild at the start of your journey, has been cleared of all trees except for birch [willow, maple, whatever], and there are no leaves on the ground . You don't see any stumps. Nature check (10 or better) and you see that many patches of the earth have been filled in with fresh soil. Careful observation reveals that this patch of the forest trail deviates slightly from your map, but recombines with the expected trail when the birch forest ends.
49	有人在这段森林小径上悬挂了灯笼。夜晚时分，它们会亮起五彩斑斓的元素光芒。偶尔，你会觉得在远离小径的森林深处也能看见一盏灯笼。或许只是你眼睛的错觉。 Someone has hung lanterns through this stretch of the forest trail. At night they light up with colorful elemental light. Every so often, you think you can see a lantern far off in the forest, away from the trail. Probably a trick of your eyes.
50	在一棵巨大的红杉树顶端，你可以清晰地看到一扇窗户，内部亮着灯光。观察片刻后，灯光熄灭，窗户也随之消失。 At the top of a massive sequoia tree you can clearly see a single window, lit from the inside. After looking for a while, the light goes out and the window disappears.
51	有人将巨大的发光球体放置在附近的树上，随着时间的推移，树木开始在这些球体上生长。这些球体发出黄橙色的光芒，直径从一英尺到四英尺不等。有些高悬在垂下的树枝上，有些则隐藏在树根之间。 Someone has placed massive glowing spheres in the trees nearby, which have begun to grow over the spheres with time. The spheres glow a yellow orange and range from one foot to 4 feet in diameter. Some are high up in drooping branches, some tucked into the roots of trees.
52	在森林中，一个模糊的人形物体引起了你的注意，仅仅一瞬间。它深藏在灌木丛中，但稍微移动头部，你勉强能辨认出一个人形轮廓。如果队伍进一步调查，他们会发现一个与人类大小相当的雕塑，完全由镜面制成，反射着周围的森林景象。 In the forest something vaguely humanoid catches your eye, just for a moment. It is deep in the brush but, moving your head slightly, you can just barely make the outline of a person. If the party inspects further they will find a human sized sculpture made entirely of a mirrored surface, to reflect the forest around them.
53	破碎的陶器散落一地。树根周围遍布着花盆的碎片，仿佛这些树木是从先前的容器中迅速破土而出。 Broken pottery scatters the ground. Pieces of broken flower pots lay all around the roots of the trees here, giving the sense that these trees burst out of their former containers rather quickly.
54	有人编织了一条长长的彩色毛线带，覆盖了接下来10码的路径。毛线似乎防污且坚韧，颜色保持如新，不知已有多久。走在上面非常柔软舒适。 Someone has knit a long winding strip of colorful yarn to cover the path for the next 10 yards. The yarn seems stain resistant and resilient, as the colors have held true for who knows how long. Walking on it is very soft and pleasant.
55	有人穿过这片森林，将土壤从路径旁挖开，形成了一种俯瞰视角的房屋结构。这个“坑”深约六英尺，内有由土壤构成的家具和墙壁，尽可能避开树根。房屋沿着小径蜿蜒延伸，形状并非传统的方形或规则。小径本身未被破坏，却将这种“房屋”一分为二。 Someone has come through this section of forest and dug the soil away from the trail to form a sort of top-down view of a home. The 'pit' is about 6 feet down, and contains furnishings and walls formed from the soil, avoiding tree roots where it can. The house meanders along the path and is not traditionally square or regular. The path is untouched, but bisects this 'house' of sorts.
56	尽管这片区域荒凉，但有人在这段小径旁种了一排玫瑰丛，玫瑰正盛开着，绚丽夺目。 Though the area here is wild, someone has planted a row of rosebushes along this section of trail, the roses are in full, brilliant bloom.
57	小径右侧矗立着一座手持巨大石剑的天使雕像，其脚下摆放着几个小袋子。 A statue of an angel with a large stone sword stands to the right of the trail. Several small pouches have been laid at its feet.
58	你听到前方传来微弱的声音。走近后，你似乎误入了一堂绘画课。不同年龄段的学生分散在田野中，支着画架描绘风景。一位年长的女教师在学生间穿梭，提供点评并指导他们。 You can hear faint voices up ahead. As you approach, you seem to have stumbled into a painting class. Students at a wide range of ages are scattered throughout the field with easels, painting the landscape. A teacher, and old woman, walks between them offering critique and guiding her students.
59	头顶的树枝上悬挂着半透明的织物，几乎触及小径。轻轻一推即可继续前行。随着小径延伸，织物从白色渐变为粉色，继而呈现出彩虹般的色彩。 The trees overhead have had translucent fabric hung from their branches, just barely reaching the trail. It is easy to push the fabric aside to continue. As the trail progresses the fabric changes from white to pink and on through a rainbow of colors.
60	这段小径旁的树干上挂着无数件婚纱，有些年代久远，被苔藓侵蚀，随着树干生长而撕裂；有些则崭新如初，洁白无瑕。 The trees along this stretch of pathway have had a myriad of wedding dresses fitted to their trunks. Some of the dresses are older, rotting away with mosses and torn by the growing trunk. Some are recent and pristine.
61	小径边缘插着约百根魔杖，尖端朝下，形成一片小棍林。每根魔杖风格各异，有些似乎正以其存在影响着周围的植物生命。 A hundred or so Wands have been stuck point first into the soil at the edge of the trail, making a small field of sticks. Each wand appears to be different in style, and some appear to be affecting the surrounding plant life with their presence.
62	小径向下倾斜，进入一片遍布巨石的区域。有人在岩石上点燃了熏香，沿路形成了一层香气浓郁的烟雾。 The trail slopes downward into a field of mostly boulders. All throughout someone has lit incense atop the rocks, creating a strongly perfumed smoky fog along the trail.
63	一只巨大的红陶罐侧放在附近溪流瀑布顶端，罐子背面被移除以便水流进入，改变了瀑布的流向，使其从罐口流出，营造出持续倾泻的效果。 A large red clay pot has been placed on its side at the top of a nearby creek falls. The back of the pot has been removed to let water flow in, changing the waterfall's course to flow out of the mouth of the pot, giving the effect of constant pouring.
64	小径旁新芽植物上覆盖着编织的树枝球体，似乎是鼓励种植的藤蔓和灌木长成球体图案，但植物才刚刚开始生长。 Woven spheres of sticks have been placed over sprouting plants along the trail. It appears the intent was to encourage planted vines and bushes to grow into the sphere pattern, but the plants have only just recently begun to grow.
65	小径转弯处生长着一棵巨大的树，看似健康，但树干被截去了整整两英尺，使得树冠悬空无支撑。在缺失的树干位置，一个水晶摆锤悬挂在树冠下方，正好位于原本树干中心。树桩底部刻有精细的符文，描绘了一个八芒星，分别标有“是”、“否”、“可信”和“欺骗”的轴。当人们经过时，摆锤会移动，指向符文的不同区域。 A huge tree grows at the bend in the trail, apparently healthy. However a full 2 feet of trunk has been removed, leaving the top of the tree hovering, fully unsupported. In place of the missing trunk, a crystal pendulum is attached to the top part of the tree, hanging down in the center of the would-be trunk. A detailed glyph has been burned into the bottom stump depicting an 8 pointed star with axis for 'Yes', 'No', 'Trusted' and 'Deceiver'. As people walk by the pendulum moves to point to different areas of the glyph.
66	前方一棵树不合时令地盛开。细看每朵花基部都紧贴着一枚银戒。取下戒指会导致花朵凋零枯萎。 A tree ahead is blooming out of season. Upon closer inspection at the base of each blossom a silver ring fits snugly. Removing the ring causes the blossom to wither and die.
67	前方山径陡峭，通向一处悬崖，悬崖上有下行阶梯。沿途有几个由当地泉水形成的人造绿松石色水池，层层叠落。每个水池相连，池中设有可容纳5至10人的水下长凳。四周不见他人踪影。 Ahead the mountain trail gives way down a steep cliff with a descending staircase. Along the way, several man-made turquoise pools of water cascade down into one another from a local spring. The pools each feed into one another and have a submerged bench to seat between 5 and 10. No other people can be seen.
68	你继续前行，开始注意到几处蜘蛛网捕捉着晨露。蛛网逐渐增多，丝线闪烁着彩虹般的光泽。不久后，厚重如毯的乳白色蛛丝垂挂在路径上。最终，蛛网如同出现时一般悄然消失，小径再次清晰。接下来的日子里，你的队伍不再受到昆虫的侵扰。 You began noticing a few spider webs catching morning dew as you continue. The webbing becomes more and more common and as it does, the strands shimmer with iridescent color. After a while thick and heavy opal strands drape over the trail like blankets. Eventually the webbing fades like it appeared, and the trail is clear again. For the rest of the day, your party is unperturbed by insects.
69	小径穿过一片空地，中央有一圈马车。这些马车看起来已被植被覆盖且腐朽。细看之下，有一群商人的雕像，姿态各异，或笑、或交易、或休息。他们全都显得很快乐。许多马车内还留有小型供品，或许是过往商人留下的？ The trail passes by a clearing with a circle of wagons at the center. The wagons appear to be overgrown and rotting. On closer inspection there are a group of statues of merchants in poses of laughter, trade, or rest. All of them appear happy. Many of the wagons contain small offerings, perhaps left by passing merchants?
70	前方清晰可见雪花飘落，无论季节如何。小径穿过一座由牙签雕刻而成的微型城镇中心。这座城镇细节极为丰富，最高的四层建筑仅及胸部高度。灯柱和房屋中的小灯已被施法点亮。雪花轻轻飘落，触地即融，积雪从未超过一英寸。 Ahead you can clearly see snow falling, regardless of season. The trail passes through the center of a miniature town sculpted from toothpicks. The town is massively detailed, with the tallest 4 story buildings only raising to chest height. Tiny lights have been enchanted in the lamp posts and houses. Snow gently falls here, landing in the soil, but never accumulates more than an inch.
71	前方的森林中遍布各式各样的鸟屋，鸟食散落一地，鸟食罐悬挂在小径旁。整个森林充满了鸟鸣声，生机勃勃。 The forest ahead is filled with birdhouses of various shapes and styles. Birdseed has been scattered, and birdfeeders hang off from the trail. The whole forest is alive with bird calls.
72	你偶然发现一座横跨峡谷的长桥。向东北方望去，你看到另一座由倒下的树木制成的桥，比这座更为原始。一群麋鹿、鹿、狼和小型动物正平静地一起过桥。当它们到达对岸时，你再也看不到它们了。 You happen across a long bridge spanning a chasm. Glancing to the northeast you see another bridge, made of a fallen tree and much more wild than this one. A procession of elk, deer, wolves and smaller creatures are crossing the bridge calmly together. When they reach the other side you can no longer see them.
73	你听到远处传来吱呀声。进行感知检定以发现，在森林深处，有一座建筑。远离小径的地方有一艘被藤蔓覆盖的帆船，船帆展开并随风飘扬。船体上有一个大洞。树木和苔藓已经侵占了这艘船。 You hear the sound of distant creaking. Perception check to spot, deep in the forest, a structure. Far off the trail is an overgrown sailing ship, sails unfurled and billowing. There is a large hole in the hull. Trees and mosses have overtaken the ship.
74	小径延伸至悬崖边缘，俯瞰前方的村庄，片片农田如拼布般铺展在下方。一座高耸的教堂塔楼从木屋之间拔地而起。一阵疾风掠过大地，压弯了一排植物，卷起烟囱中升起的炊烟。 The trail opens to a cliff's edge, overlooking the village ahead, rolling patches of farmland quilt the land below. A tall church tower rises up from between the wooden homes. A gust of wind pulls across the land, making a ridge of bowed plants and curling the smoke from the chimneys.
75	一对巨大的鹿角横跨小径，高悬在队伍头顶，留有充足空间。鹿角各处悬挂着闪烁的细绳，绳上系着吹制的玻璃星星。 A pair of gigantic antlers are arched over the trail, over the party's heads with room to spare. Glistening strings with blown glass stars have been hung from various points on the antlers.
76	小径在一片开阔的田野上渐渐消失，几群当地人散落在草地上的毯子上，吃着东西，笑声不断。这些群体似乎是朋友和家人，许多孩子在奔跑嬉戏。据当地巫师说，今晚极光将盛大登场，人们已陆续抵达，抢占好位置。 The trail peters out over an open field, several groups of locals are scattered in the grasses on blankets, eating and laughing. The groups appear to be friends and families, with many children running and playing. Tonight the Northern Lights are expected to make a great showing, according to the local wizard, and people are already arriving to get good seats.
77	小径旁有一半从巨石上雕刻出的石面，仅这一半就比任何队员都高。沿路一英里处，是石面的另一半。再往前，是一只握着剑柄的手和剑的碎片。接着是另一只手，握着一座小屋大小的灯笼，由某种魔法力量点亮。灯笼周围的植物已枯萎成灰。下一个村庄的中心是一座巨大的石台。 The trail passes by half a stone face carved from a boulder, Just this half of the face is taller than any party member. A mile down the trail, the other half of the face. Farther still, a hand holding a sword hilt and the broken fragments of sword. Then another hand holding onto a lantern the size of a small house, lit by some magical force. The plant life around this lantern has withered to dust. At the center of the next village is a massive stone platform.
78	这片森林树木上的颜料标记从特定视角看会组合成一个精灵的肖像，从其他角度看则只是一片混乱的涂鸦。 Paint marks on the trees of this forest come together from one specific viewing angle to form the portrait of an elf, from all other angles the paint simply looks like a chaotic mess.
79	小径旁有一面圆形镜子，由一尊雕像从背后托举。雕像描绘了一个披着斗篷的男子，脖子长得不可思议，面部形似仓鸮，正从镜子上方窥视并凝视着镜中的自己。 The trail passes by a circular mirror which is being held from behind by a statue. The Statue depicts a man in a cloak with an impossibly long neck and the face of a barn owl, peering over the top of the mirror and gazing at itself.
80	小径旁散布着直径约两英尺的空心铁球，铁壳被雕刻成森林场景，每个球展示不同的金属景观。有人在每个球内点燃了篝火，火光透过铁雕镂空处投射，照亮了小路。 Along the trail are spheres of iron, hollow on the inside about 2 feet in diameter. The iron shell has been cut out to show a forest scene made in metal, each sphere has a different scene. Someone has set a campfire inside each. The fire on the inside of the sculpture backlights the iron cutouts, and lights the trail.
81	有人将服装模特摆放在小径旁。随着时间的推移，森林重新占据了这些模特。苔藓覆盖了部分，藤蔓攀爬其上，花朵在其中一个的基部盛开，形成了非常引人注目的领口。每个模特似乎都长出了一件美丽的礼服或西装。 Someone has placed dress forms along the trail. Over time the forest has re-claimed the dress forms. Mosses drape over some, vines crawl up others, flowers have bloomed around the base of one, making a very impressive neckline. Each mannequin seems to have grown a beautiful dress or suit.
82	几棵树的树干被剥去了所有的枝干和树皮，残存的木头上雕刻着人脸和动物形态，依然扎根于地面。 Several tree trunks have been stripped of all branches and bark. Faces and animal forms have been carved into the remaining wood, still rooted to the ground.
83	在葱郁的绿林中，一条小径旁放置着一个巨大的黑曜石圆环，直径约20英尺。它由锻铁腿支撑，离地约2英尺高。最近的降雨使略微凹陷的表面充满了光滑如镜的水面。凝视片刻后，一滴水从树上落下，打破了平静的水面。 In the lush green forest a massive circle of obsidian, about 20 feet across, has been placed just off the trail. It is elevated off the ground about 2 feet, held up by wrought iron legs. A recent rainfall has filled the slightly concave surface with perfectly smooth reflective water. After looking for a moment, a drop of water falls from a tree, disturbing the smooth surface.
84	有人没有在溪流上建桥，而是在下方挖了隧道。隧道内被一群发光蛾照亮。 Rather than building a bridge over the top of this stream, someone has tunneled underneath. Inside the tunnel is lit by a cluster of luminescent moths.
85	森林似乎正在从一两年前的大火中恢复。火灾过后，有人用彩色透明树脂浇灌半烧焦的树木和原木的裂缝，重塑被烧毁的部分。随着植被的重新生长，森林显得明亮而超现实。 The forest seems to be recovering from a fire, perhaps one or two years prior. In the wake of the fire someone has come through with colorful translucent resin, pouring it in the cracks of half burned trees and logs and reshaping the portions that has been burned. With the returning overgrowth the forest appears bright and surreal.
86	小径右侧堆放着几个动物头骨，每个头骨都被精细雕刻了复杂图案，且未破坏头骨的结构完整性。 Several animal skulls are piled to the right of the trail. Each one has been delicately carved with an intricate pattern, without losing the structural integrity of the skulls.
87	在小径转弯处，右侧不远处，有人放置了一根高7英尺、表面光滑的白色大理石圆柱。绕到圆柱背面，可见一条深裂缝中雕刻着一张极其精细的面孔。 At a bend in the trail, just off to the right, someone has placed a perfectly smooth cylinder of white marble, 7 feet tall. Walking around to the back of the cylinder reveals a highly detailed face has been carved into a deep crack in the marble.
88	小径两侧各放置着一对巨大的石翼，伸向天空。 On either side of the trail Two massive stone wings have been placed, reaching toward the sky.
89	一条巨大的幻象锦鲤沿着小径在森林树木间游动，不时俯冲而下，径直穿过队伍。每次穿过时，空气中都弥漫着新鲜薄荷的香气。 A massive illusionary koi fish swims through the forest trees along the trail. Every so often dipping down to pass right through the party. Each time it does, the air smells of fresh mint.
90	有人将旧铲子的头部取下，固定在底部，制作成一个巨大的金属松果，并出于某种原因将其放置在这条小径上。 Someone has taken the heads of old broken shovels and attached them at the base to make a huge metal pine cone. Then they placed it on this trail, for some reason.
91	起初你以为有人撒了一袋硬币，但随后发现散落的硬币越来越密集，几乎像一幅马赛克。大约10码的小径被硬币完美铺就，之后小径再次消失。这些硬币似乎来自不同地区，面额都很小。你是否该留下一些硬币来延续这条小径呢？ At first you think perhaps someone has spilled a bag of coins, but you realize that the scattered coins get more and more dense, almost like a mosaic. For about 10 yards the trail is perfectly paved with coins before the trail peters out again. The coins here appear to be from all different regions, in small denominations. Should you leave some coins to further the trail too?
92	小径此处悬挂着蚊帐。除了免受蚊虫侵扰，你还有机会近距离观察网另一侧几只美丽的飞蛾与蝴蝶，它们似乎未察觉网中的你。 The trail here has been draped with mosquito netting. In addition to freeing you from the pestering of insects, you also have a chance to see several beautiful moths and butterflies up close from the other side of the net, they don't seem to notice you while you are in the netting.
93	一只流浪狗在小径上向你走来，决定与你同行。它脖子上系着一条红色头巾。大约走了一英里后，它又独自离开了。 A stray dog wanders up to you on the trail and decides to walk with you. He has a red bandanna tied around his neck. After about a mile or so he wanders off again.
94	经过一条宽阔的溪流时，你瞥见一只流浪猫走入水中。令你震惊的是，水流绕着猫弯曲，使其保持完全干燥。猫灵巧地一抓，从面前的水墙中捕到一条鱼，然后离开溪流，依然干燥，现已饱餐。 Passing by a wide stream you spy a stray cat walking into the water. To your shock the water arcs around the cat, keeping it perfectly dry. With a deft swipe the cat snatches a fish from the water wall in front of it, and leaves the stream, still dry, now fed.
95	小径变成了一块石头跳房子游戏板。 The trail has become a stone hopscotch board.
96	你遇到一块装饰精美的小牌子，上面写着“化装舞会小径——大声说出你的装扮”。不发出请求就无法通过这块牌子。在接下来的6英里小径上，你所请求的装扮幻象将环绕着你。沿途会有几位其他装扮的旅人经过。 You come upon a small decorated sign that reads 'the masquerade trail - Speak aloud your costume' The sign can not be passed without speaking a request. For the next 6 miles of trail an illusion of the requested costume surrounds you. Along the trail several other costumed travelers pass.
97	一尊巨大的金属钥匙雕塑倚靠在一棵古树上，上面标有“重要”字样。 A sculpture of a giant metal key leans against an old tree. It is labeled 'Important'.
98	小径穿过一道六英尺高的白墙，墙从北向南直线延伸，看不到尽头。穿过墙壁，内侧呈现出两幅动态场景：北面墙上是一个雪村，几个孩子正在打雪仗；南面墙上则是一座热闹的城市，正值节日庆典。这堵墙由方解石构成，这种岩石能折射光线与影像。 The trail bisects a white wall, 6 feet high. The wall moves from north to south in a straight line, with no end in sight. Passing through the wall the interior side shows two different scenes, in motion. On the wall running north; a snowy village with several children having a snowball fight. On the wall running south; A bustling city in the midst of a festival. The wall is made of calcite, a Rock that refracts light and images.
99	小径豁然开朗，进入一片田野，几座巨大的金属环支撑着天体雕塑。太阳和月亮被雕刻成两位女性面孔上的多彩明亮球体。其他行星和重要恒星各自拥有独立的环。这些环似乎与天体同步移动，准确描绘了从雕塑中心观察到的天体位置。 The path opens up into a field where several gigantic metal rings support celestial sculptures. The Sun and Moon are represented by colorful and bright spheres carved into the faces of two women. Other planets and important stars have their own rings. It appears that the rings move in time with the celestial bodies, accurately depicting their position from the perspective of someone at the center of the sculpture.
100	森林变得精心打理，更像一座花园而非荒野。接下来一英里内，每棵树的根部都有一张小桌，桌上摆放着盆栽，完美地复制了其所在树木的微缩版。一英里后，你遇到一位正在照料盆栽的老人，他的盆栽尚未完全与其对应的树木相匹配。老人邀请你共进餐食，并接受森林的祝福。 The forest has changed to become meticulously kept, more like a garden than the wilderness. At the base of each forest tree for the next mile is a small table with a bonsai tree, a perfect miniature of the tree it has been placed under. After a mile you come across an elderly man who is tending to a bonsai, not yet quite perfectly matching it respective tree. The Man invites you for a meal and a blessing from the forest.
