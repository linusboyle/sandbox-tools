1d100	诅咒-地城
1	食用奇异真菌的饮食使得比皮革更重的盔甲变得不适 A diet of strange Fungus renders armor heavier than Leather uncomfortable
2	在幸运地从桶中觅得腌黄瓜并以此维生过久后，如今哪怕是最轻微的醋味也会让你作呕。 After subsisting on Pickles from a fortuitous Barrel for entirely too long, now even the slightest whiff of vinegar makes you retch
3	你所经之处，脚步会盐化土地，草木枯萎死亡，需整整一个季节才能恢复生机。 After where you've been, your footsteps salt the earth, grass and vegetation will wither and die, taking a full Season to recover
4	地牢中的旅店？美味佳肴，美酒畅饮。你醒来时却在外头，还宿醉未醒。如今地面上的酒馆老板似乎对你心存戒备。 An Inn in a Dungeon? Delicious food, freely flowing libation. You woke up outside and hungover. Now topside Tavernkeepers seem to distrust you
5	你对门扉曾经抱有的任何信任如今已荡然无存，通常需要他人替你开启它们 Any Trust you once had in Doors is now irrevocably gone, someone else usually must open them for you
6	刚好赶上听到你的悼词/见证你的葬礼，并非所有言辞都是赞美之词 Arrived just in time to hear your Eulogy/Witness your Funeral, Not everything said was complimentary
7	只要你继续挖掘，幽灵矮人大多不会打扰你……你学会了他们的语言（一种古老、过时的方言），但也染上了他们的贪婪。 As long as you kept digging, the Ghostly Dwarfs mostly let you be...you learned their language (an older, archaic dialect) but also gained their Greed
8	先是求援，继而恳求，最后威胁，某种更深层的东西触及了你的心灵，它们对你人生的评述让你分心 Asking for Rescue, then pleading, then resorting to Threats, something Deeper touched your mind, their Commentary on your life is distracting
9	最好别过多谈论你的新肚脐，或是那个曾经维持你生命的脐带 Best not to speak too much about your new Belly Button, or the umbilicus that kept you fed
10	汩汩涌出的泉水曾是解渴的慰藉，但贪婪地狂饮那圣水的亵渎之举如今开始纠缠着你。 Burbling Font was a welcome sight to slake your thirst, but the heresy of greedily gulping that sacramental water has come to haunt you
11	为抵御寒冷与黑暗焚烧书籍，其中一本蕴含了不可知的魔法。对你而言，奥术法术效果翻倍，神圣法术效果减半。 Burning Books to keep the Cold and Dark at bay, one contained Unknowable Magics. Arcane Spell effects double on you, Divine Spells halve.
12	浑身覆满铁锈，你仓皇穿过他们的洞穴逃出，触角颤鸣不已。如今，金属物品在你身上似乎磨损得异常迅速。 Caked in Rust, you scrambled outside via their warren, chittering antennae all awhirl. Now it seems metal things wear out a lot faster on your person
13	陷入巨大的蛛网中，你确信自己将成为蜘蛛的晚餐。达成协议后，如今你背上驮着她那嗷嗷待哺、需求无度的蛛崽们。 Caught in massive Webs, you were sure to be a Spider's Supper. Struck a deal, and now you carry her Mewling, Needy Spiderlings on your back
14	蜈蚣炖汤虽非人人能享，却曾止住你的饥肠辘辘。如今你已对其上瘾，深陷其中毒素的诱惑。 Centipede Stew is an acquired taste, but it kept your stomach from growling. Now you crave it, addicted to the Toxins within
15	长时间潮湿粘腻，手指间长出蹼膜，新生的鳃也发育得相当不错 Clammy and wet for far too long, digits develop webbing, and your new gills are coming along nicely
16	冷铁岩钉卡住了你确信是出口的门。黄霉树精这次放过了你，但你继承了她的一些特质。 Cold Iron Pitons jammed shut a door that you were certain led out. The Yellow Mould Dryad spared you this time, but you inherited some of her qualities
17	将自己扭曲成不可能的形态：你躲藏了起来，仿佛过了几天。如今，头顶开阔的天空让你变得神经兮兮。 Contorting yourself into impossible shapes: You hid. It seemed like days. Now the open Skies above you tend to make you skittish
18	水晶构造令人叹为观止，却扭曲了你的感知。意外施放的魔法会令你目盲（如同强光），但你可以随意施展侦测魔法。 Crystalline Formations were breathtaking but altered your perception. Unexpected Magic cast Blinds you (as Light), but you can Detect at will
19	诅咒你最后一支垂死的火把……火焰铭记于心。它拒绝为你点燃，所有光源都将熄灭。 Cursing your last, dying Torch...Fire remembers. It refuses to light for you and light sources snuff
20	喝了些苦涩酸臭的水。食用熟食时，肠道寄生虫会引发不适 Drank some brackish, sour Water. Gutworms revolt when cooked food is eaten
21	暴露于奇异辐射之下，如今任何探测魔法都将你视为有效目标。某些剑误认你为龙，法术则视你为邪恶存在。 Exposed to strange Radiations, now any Detection Magic considers you a valid target. Some Swords think you are a Dragon, Spells consider you Evil
22	无表情的铁面具与你的脸融为一体，若你提及它的来历或试图移除它，面具便会开始发热。 Expressionless Mask of Iron, fused with your face, it begins to heat up if you speak of how it came to be there or think of removing it
23	目光落在一些奇异符号上，跳动的符文烙印入你的脑海。随机重新确定你掌握的所有语言。 Eyes landed on some Strange Sigils and the throbbing Glyphs seared into your brain. Randomly re-determine all your Languages
24	相当确定那个顽固的魔像永远不会厌倦追捕你，幸运的是它只在夜间行动，而且目前行动极其缓慢。 Fairly certain that stubborn Golem will never tire of chasing you, fortunately it only travels at night and is ponderously slow for now
25	狼人身上的跳蚤已侵染了你的衣物和头发，虽尚未变化，但银器正让你身上冒出令人不适的荨麻疹。 Fleas from Lycanthropes have infested your clothes and hair, no changing yet but Silver is making you break out in unpleasant Hives
26	在黑暗中摸索，你的手指触碰到那光滑的铁质方尖碑。若遇风暴，立即寻找庇护：闪电对你虎视眈眈。 Fumbling in the Dark, your fingers rested on that smooth, iron Obelisk. Should it Storm, seek shelter immediately: Lightning lusts for you
27	食尸鬼抓住了你。它们真的是食尸鬼吗？你被冻住，只能眼睁睁地看着它们：它们似乎注视了你数日之久。如今，唯有腐肉能滋养你。 Ghouls got you. Were they Ghouls? You were frozen and had to watch them: watching you for what seemed like days. Only carrion nourishes you now
28	手套暂时能遮掩，但你的手有些不对劲，皮肤干燥脱皮，很快将只剩骨头 Gloves will conceal it for now, but something's not right with your hands, skin is desiccated and flaky, soon it will be just the bones
29	难耐的饥饿驱使你打开了那些卡诺匹斯罐，里面并无可食之物，但你那新生的枯萎之心意味着你将永远无法寻得真爱。 Gnawing hunger led you to break open those Canopic Jars, nothing edible inside, but your new shriveled Heart means you'll never find Love
30	对幸福和欢乐麻木不仁，微笑和大笑会给你带来身体上的痛苦 Hardened against happiness and joy, smiling, and laughing causes you physical pain
31	号角/长笛堵塞，琴弦断裂，鼓皮裂开，甚至哨子也走调。自从你出来后，你就成了吟游诗人的敌人。 Horns/Flutes Clog, Strings Snap, Drum-skins split, and even whistles veer out of tune. You are no friend of Bards since you got out
32	如此可爱的小猫为何会出现在这里，你百思不得其解。如今它长出了邪恶的眼睛/触手，对你的朋友们并不友好。 How such a cute Kitten ended up down here is beyond you. Now it's growing up with malevolent eyes/tentacles and doesn't take to your friends
33	被所见恐怖所震慑，怪物能嗅到这份恐惧，轻易发现你的踪迹 Humbled by the Horrors you saw, Monsters can smell this fear and have no issue detecting you
34	无意间破坏了那个魔法阵，放出了某个东西。那个东西心怀感激，但以极其占有欲的方式表达出来。 Inadvertently marring that Magic Circle let Something out. The Something is grateful, but shows it in very possessive ways
35	当你试图取下腕上的铁镣时，它们开始剧烈发热，带来痛苦，不过至少链条已断，仅剩几节残留。 Iron cuffs on your wrists begin to Heat painfully when you try to have them removed, at least the Chain is broken now and only a few links remain
36	虽然需要一些适应，但单色渲染的世界并不算太糟……但为什么地精的工艺品是彩色的？ It took some adjustment, but a world rendered in monochrome isn't too bad...but why are Goblin crafts in color?
37	这一切都是为了黄金！愚蠢、一文不值的黄金！一旦被你的赤手触碰，它将贬值为铅。 It was all for Gold! Stupid, worthless Gold! Touched by your bare hand, it will debase to Lead
38	就在所有希望即将破灭之际，一座祭坛显现。幽灵般的烟雾天使轻抚着你，让你从裂缝中飘然脱身。然而，某些表面仍会背叛你。 Just when all hope was lost, an Altar. Ghostly Smoke Angels caressed you and let you drift out through cracks. Some surfaces still betray you.
39	暂时隐藏起来还算容易，因为你头上长出的蛇还很年幼……但很孤独 Keeping it hidden is easy enough for now, because the Serpent sprouting from your head is still very young...but lonely
40	与一个幽灵达成了协议，它安全地带你离开。然而，你的承诺即将兑现：每年它都会附身你一周。 Made a deal with a Ghost, who led you out safely. Your end of the bargain is coming up though: Gets to Possess you for 1 week each year
41	地图会撒谎。它们只会带你越走越深。永远不要相信地图，尤其是它们似乎在你手中会诡异地变换路线。 Maps lie. They just lead you deeper. Never trust a Map, especially since they seem to strategically shift in your possession
42	虽仁慈地免于回忆噩梦，但你的磨牙声仍足以惊醒他人 Mercifully spared from remembering the Nightmares, your teeth still grind loud enough to wake up others
43	木乃伊腐烂、鼠疫、哥布林痘……你全染上了，却奇怪地没有任何症状。确实具有传染性，但自身却未受影响。 Mummy Rot, Rat Fever, Goblin Pox...you caught 'em all but strangely showed no symptoms. Contagious yes, but affected, no.
44	几乎所有人都不相信，但自从你出来后，星座的排列与以前大不相同了。 Nearly everyone is incredulous when you mention it, but the Constellations used to be very different than they are since you got out
45	无论你如何努力，都无法彻底清理那肮脏的巢穴。直到鹰身女妖死去，诅咒才被打破，如今你再也无法忍受任何混乱。 No matter how you tried, you could never get that filthily nest clean. Took the Harpy's death to break the spell and now you can't stand a mess
46	并非首个迷失者。偶然遇见他人。人多安全。你许下七个承诺，其中两个相互冲突。 Not the first to be Lost. Stumbled upon Others. Safety in Numbers. You made seven promises and two conflict.
47	仅仅是一撮头发和几片指甲，这就是女巫所要的全部。你开始觉得这或许不是最划算的交易。 Only a clump of Hair and few Fingernails, that was all the Witch asked. You're beginning to think it wasn't the best of bargains
48	苍白且布满啄痕，那些吸血蝙蝠显然盯上了你。残留在血液中的大量唾液使你失去了凝血能力。 Pale and peck-marked, those Stirges surely had your number. The amount of saliva still in your bloodstream means you no longer clot
49	羊皮纸、纸张、犊皮纸在你触碰下都会变成恶臭的泥浆……不过至少你现在明白为什么那些药水都没有标签了。 Parchment, Paper, Vellum all turn to stinking sludge with your touch...but at least you now know why all those Potions had no labels
50	或许是违背了你的理智，你饮用了看起来最安全的那池水。不幸的是，它相当魔法，导致角色职业转变。 Perhaps against your better judgement, you drank from the Pool that looked the safest. It was unfortunately quite Magical, switch Character ClassesDraft Version 12.07.2021: d4caltrops.com
51	只要确保那散发着刺鼻香料气味的绷带紧贴皮肤且完好无损，腐化便会停止。 Provided you keep the pungent, spice-scented wrappings intact and tight upon your skin the Rot is halted
52	尽管你发现硬饼干上蠕动着幼虫，你还是吃下了它，现在你携带的食物会迅速变质。 Pulsing with writhing larvae you ate the Hard Tack you found anyway, now food spoils so quickly when you carry it
53	鼠肉让你得以果腹，老鼠成了你的朋友，如今你无法忍受食用其他生灵的肉 Rat Meat kept you fed, the Rats became friends, now you can't bear to eat the flesh of another living creature
54	竖琴上繁复的涡纹木料燃烧得足够旺盛，但当雕刻开始哭泣时，你不得不移开视线。从此你再也听不到音乐了。 Richly whorled wood of the Harp burnt well enough, but you had to look away when carvings started crying. You can no longer hear music
55	与深林仙灵狂欢让你安全且饱食，他们放你离开，但条件是为你未婚妻/未婚夫带回一件合适的婚礼礼物。 Roistering with the Deep Faerie kept you safe and fed, they let you leave, but only to get a suitable Wedding Gift for your betrothed
56	手掌上的绳索烧伤深深刻入，偶尔阵阵作痛，每当你掷出14点时便会掉落手中的物品。 Rope burn across your palms gouges deep and throbs occasionally, you drop a held item whenever you roll a 14
57	面颊与肩部因与引魂者擦肩而过而留下象牙色疤痕，这些疤痕使你如同亡灵般可被驱散 Scarred on face and shoulder by a brush with the Psychopomp, these ivory scars mean you can be Turned as Undead
58	散落的骸骨间，你发现了一些美味的甲虫并大快朵颐，却不知它们也吞噬了死者的记忆，这些记忆与你的混淆在一起。 Scattering Bones, you came across some Tasty Beetles to eat, not knowing that they had also consumed the memories of the dead which muddle with yours
59	地牢的阴湿腐朽之气随你而来：被裸手或嘴唇触碰的水果会立即腐烂成恶心的泥浆 Some of the dank, dark, rot followed you topside: Fruit touched by bare hand or lips immediately spoils into a sickly sludge
60	某种原始而古老的东西，悄然侵入了你的心智。文字令其恐惧，阅读会给你带来痛苦。 Something primal and primeval, wormed its way into your mind. The written word scares it, and reading causes you pain
61	壮观。令人屏息。这颗宝石美得让人无法抗拒，如今它已嵌入你的掌心，血肉环绕。抓握能力受损 Spectacular. Breathtaking. The Gem was too beautiful to pass up, and now it's embedded in your palm with flesh knit around it. Grip impaired
62	脚步稳健且满载补给，若非那头骡子，你早已命丧黄泉。她理应享受你给予的每一分奢华。 Sure-footed and laden with provisions, if it weren't for that Mule, you'd never have survived. She deserves every bit of luxury you lavish on her
63	出乎意料地礼貌，幽魂向你提出了一项交易：整理她的地下墓穴（已被洗劫一空）。你看到一个壁龛上刻着你的名字。 Surprisingly civil, the Wraith offered you a deal: Neaten her Catacombs (rather ransacked). You saw a niche with your name on the plate though
64	你发誓能看见它在你的皮肤下游动，起伏波动。治疗师告诉你那只是幻觉，但随后你也在她的脖子上看到了它。 Swear you can see it, swimming under your skin. It ripples and undulates. Healer told you it was nothing, but then you saw it in her neck too.
65	为了换取自由，将火焰的秘密传授给野性石像鬼，这显然不是个明智之举 Teaching the secrets of Fire to the Feral Gargoyles in exchange for your Freedom surely wasn't the best of ideas
66	幸好未带毒，弩矢虽易断，但那恶毒的倒钩头却难以取出，时不时还会往肉里钻得更深一些。 Thankfully not envenomed, the Quarrel broke off easy but the wickedly barbed head eludes removal, periodically digging just a little deeper
67	那幅画（或是挂毯？雕像）。一位少女在海边哀伤地等待。海洋塞壬的呼唤越来越难以抗拒。 That painting (or was it a tapestry? A statue). A Maiden mournfully waiting by the Sea. The Siren's call of the Ocean is getting harder to resist
68	带刺的棘刺刺痛并深入你的血肉，你试图将它们全部拔出，但时不时（掷骰结果为8时）会有一根蠕动并刺痛你。 The Barbed Quills stung and dug deeper into your flesh, you tried to get them all out, but every so often (on a roll of 8) one wiggles and stings
69	刺鼻的烟雾可能是你最后闻到的气味，而且它们绝对不令人愉快。这种气味时不时地冒出来，就像劣质铜器散发出的恶臭。 The caustic fumes may be the last thing you will ever smell, and they certainly weren't pleasant. The Smell turns up, like a bad Copper, from time to time
70	你留下的粉笔记号曾是你避免迷路的唯一依靠。如今，它们却出现在树上……以及人身上。 The Chalk Markers you left for yourself were the only thing that helped you not get turned around. Now they show up on Trees...and People
71	你找到的那个廉价锡制酒杯似乎紧紧粘在了手上，有趣的是，哪怕只喝一小口也会让你烂醉如泥。 The cheap Pewter Flagon you found seems stuck fast in your hand, and interestingly, even the slightest bit of tipple gets you utterly blotto
72	你偷来的那枚硬币迅速吞噬了你钱袋中的其他硬币，硬币上古代国王的面容变得越来越肥胖。摆脱它变得异常困难。 The Coin you stole swiftly ate others in your pouch, the Ancient King on the Face growing more and more corpulent. Ridding yourself of it has proven hard
73	咳嗽总在不合时宜的时候发作，起初并不太令人担忧，直到有一天手帕上的血迹开始拼写出亵渎之语。 The Cough seems to come at inopportune times, not too concerning until the day the blood on your handkerchief starts spelling out Heresies
74	老妪背着你离开了地牢。你原本失明，她取走了一只眼睛作为报酬。你偶尔能看见她所见，并确信她也能通过你的眼睛窥视。 The Crone carried you out on her back. Blind before, she took an Eye as payment. You can sometimes see what she sees, and are sure she can see from you
75	震耳欲聋的寂静仍在耳畔回响，令人分心，使你更容易受到惊吓和突袭。 The Deafening Silence still rings in your ears. Distracting and making you more easily startled and surprised
76	污垢堆积得如此厚重，清洗起来耗时漫长，而且似乎总也洗不完。雨滴落在皮肤上会有些刺痛。 The filth was caked on so thick; it took ages to scrub off, and there always seems to be more. Raindrops sting a bit on your skin
77	幸好那凝视并未完全生效，你得以逃脱。但一条肢体僵硬如石，成了这次遭遇的纪念品。 The Gaze didn't quite take thankfully, and you were able to flee. One limb is stiff and stony though, a souvenir of your encounter
78	陷阱虽不深，但尖刺锈迹斑斑。你的关节开始僵硬，很快将无法言语。 The Pit wasn't deep, but the spikes were quite Rusty. Your joints have begun to stiffen, and soon you'll be unable to speak
79	鳞族们看起来确实足够友好，他们愿意用水和一条出路来交换。而这一切的代价，只是你的舌头。 The Scaled Ones certainly seemed friendly enough, they were willing to trade water, and a way out. All it cost you was your tongue
80	那恶臭，那可怕的恶臭。无论你如何沐浴，它都附着在你的衣物上。你再也无法给人留下良好的第一印象了。 The Stench. That horrible Stench. You smell it on your clothes, no matter how you bathe. You don't make the best first impressions anymore
81	“布瑞-亚克”的嘲讽仍刺痛着你，但哥布林们竟意外地信守诺言，在你绘制了附近定居点的地图后释放了你。 The taunts of Bree-Yark still sting, but the Goblins were usurpingly true to their word and released you after you drew them maps of the nearby settlements
82	陷阱极为残酷，你甚至考虑过咬断自己的脚踝。虽然最终脱困，但移动速度现在减半。 The Trap was brutal, you contemplated gnawing off your ankle. You got free, but Movement is now halved
83	你挖掘的隧道虽无法赢得矮人的赞赏，但总算派上了用场。不过，你发现自己总在不当的时候咳出小石子。 The Tunnel you dug won't win any admiration from Dwarfs, but it worked. You find yourself coughing up pebbles at inopportune times though
84	未经证实的传闻称，在新月之夜有人看到你重返地下城，通常还带着同伴。 Unconfirmed rumors report seeing you, going back in, on Nights of the New Moon. You usually have someone with you
85	被故障的异界传送门扭曲，所有魔法（包括物品效果）在对你使用或针对你时都会反转 Warped by a malfunctioning Eldritch Portal, all Magic (the effects of items included) is reversed when used or targeted upon you
86	泪流如墨，双眼化为乌黑玛瑙，尖锐的新牙顶替旧齿。地精熊怪是如何诞生的来着？ Weeping Inky Tears, your eyes turn Onyx Black and new pointier Teeth push out the old. How are Bugbears made again?
87	为何每晚的睡眠都伴随着身临其境的梦境，仿佛仍困其中（无法恢复生命值）？你不是已经逃脱了吗？ Why does every night's Sleep have such vivid dreams of still being there (no healing)? You Escaped. Didn't You?
88	岁月未至却已显老态，头发变得雪白，皮肤布满忧虑的皱纹 Wizened beyond your Years, hair turned stark white and skin is wracked with worry lines
89	是啊，你死了。起初感觉还不错，就像躺在一张温暖舒适的床上。但现在，每当有人把你从沉睡中唤醒，你就会猛烈地反击。 Yeah, you died. Wasn't so bad at first really, just like a nice, warm, cozy bed. Now you violently lash out whenever you are roused from slumber
90	你能够在黑暗中视物，但阳光如今令你痛苦（如同兽人一般）。 You can see in the Dark, but now Sunlight is painful (as Orc)
91	你发现了它！一扇巧妙隐藏的秘门。如今它们似乎都带着几分怨气，刻意避开你的注意。 You found it! A Secret Door devilishly concealed. Now they all seem a bit bitter, and go out of their way to be unnoticed by you
92	你诱使一颗会说话的头骨为你指路。如今，头骨们在你面前纷纷开口，编造关于你过去的谎言。 You inveigled a talking Skull to tell you the way out. Now Skulls are stirred to speak up in your presence, spouting lies about your past
93	你成功找到了安全的出口，但似乎没有家人能认出你，甚至连朋友都难以记起你的名字 You made a safe egress, but it would seem that no family member recognizes you, and even friends have trouble remembering your name
94	你完好无损地逃了出来。身体上如此。但你丢失了一部分灵魂。赋予生命的魔法对你无效。 You made it out intact. Physically. But you dropped a part of your Soul. Life-giving magic will not work on you.
95	你唱诵着让剑伤愈合，流血止住了，但任何你用赤手触碰的人现在都会承受这道伤口 You sang the Sword wound shut, and the bleeding stopped, but anyone you touch with bare hands receives the wound now
96	为了抵御那令人窒息的寂静，你开始低声自言自语。如今，在黑暗中，有时你会听到自己的声音回应着你。 You took to talking to yourself in a whisper to stave off the oppressive Silence. Now, sometimes, in the Dark, you hear your voice answering
97	你触碰了某物，现在手上泛起了病态的绿色磷光。无法洗掉，有时还会在你接触的表面上残留。 You touched something and now a sickly green phosphorescence glows on your hands. Won't wash off, lingers sometimes on surfaces you touch
98	自从那次探险后，你的影子似乎变得不同了，它更加愤怒，边缘参差不齐，有时还会自主移动。 Your Shadow hasn't seemed the same since the foray, it's angrier, with jagged edges and sometimes moves of its own volition
99	你的武器曾救你一命，它永远不会离开你。想到要用其他武器替换它，你就感到厌恶。 Your Weapon saved you. It will never leave you. The thought of replacing it with another is repugnant to you
100	你不确定那些蛋是谁下的，但它们确实美味。希望没人注意到你开始长出的稀疏羽毛。 You're not sure what laid those Eggs, but they were delicious. Hopefully no one notices the scraggly feathers you're starting to sprout
