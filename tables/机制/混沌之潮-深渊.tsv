1d20	混沌之潮-深渊
1	肥硕、银色的蝌蚪，形似精子，从你的泪腺中挤出，若在水中放置三周，它们将成熟为四肢修长、半透明、乳白色且无眼的蛙类。蛙的舌头懒洋洋地从口中渗出后又缩回，其叫声如咕噜声，你从未见其进食。舔舐此蛙为强力催情剂。10%的几率效果永久持续。 Fat, silvery tadpoles that look more like sperm squeeze out of your tear ducts, if kept in water for 3 weeks they will mature into long-limbed vaguely translucent milky frogs without eyes. The frog's tongue oozes lazily from its mouth before being drawn back in, its croak is a gurgle, you never see it feed. Licking the frog is a powerful aphrodisiac. 10% chance the effects are permanent.
2	施法者周围30英尺范围内会突然长出亮蓝色的蘑菇。需通过敏捷检定才能在其中移动。若踩碎蘑菇，它会发出如同电锯砍树般的尖叫声。若未能通过毒素豁免，蘑菇喷出的孢子会让你跪地，疯狂地将破碎的蘑菇塞入口中。一周后，你的身体某处会在一夜之间长出一簇蘑菇。这些蘑菇会在一天后自行腐烂，在皮肤上留下蓝色痕迹，否则它们会再次喷出孢子，重复这一过程。 Bright blue mushrooms sprout within a 30' radius from the caster. Roll under Dexterity to move amongst them. If you break one it screams the way you imagine a tree screams while being cut down with a chainsaw. Save vs. Poison or the spores it sprays into the air drive you to fall to your knees and shovel the ruined mushroom into your mouth. In a week a crop of mushrooms will grow from a random place on your body overnight. They'll decay on their own after a day, leaving a blue stain on your skin, otherwise they spray spores into the air, repeat.
3	在接下来的d4轮中，施法者的每个孔洞都会涌出厚厚的、一英寸长的深红色蛆虫，它们掉落时爆裂并融化。 Thick, inch long crimson maggots pour from the caster's every orifice for the next d4 rounds, popping and melting as they fall.
4	几何轮廓在你皮肤下隆起，扭曲摩擦，如同拼图般疯狂试图自我解决。但愿它不会，但有1%的几率它会成功。 Geometric outlines raise beneath your skin and twist and grind against each other like a puzzle desperately trying to solve itself. Hope it doesn't, 1% chance it does.
5	动物魅惑。接下来的d6小时内，任何嗅到你气味的动物都会对你产生爱慕之情。由裁判决定何种生物算作动物。当信息素效果消退时，它们会感到失落，可能因你不再散发迷人气息而对你不满。 Animal magnetism. For the next d6 hours any animal that catches your scent becomes amorously infatuated with you. Referee discretion on what counts as an animal. When the pheromones wear off it will be like coming down for them, they may not be too happy with you for not smelling as good.
6	一个至少具有人类智力的随机目标（包括施法者）会跪倒在地，双手紧捂耳朵，发出超越听觉的尖叫声，同时眼中闪烁着难以理解的光芒，直到他们通过对抗毒素的豁免检定。有10%的几率他们的智慧值增加1点。 A random target of at least human intelligence (including the caster) falls to their knees and clasps their hands over their ears, screaming in a pitch beyond hearing while incomprehensible light shines from their eyes until they save vs. Poison. 10% chance their Wisdom increases by 1.
7	双眼涌出鲜血，使你失明d4回合。你感觉如果在施法前双手沾满鲜血，就能得到保护。实际上，无论怎样鲜血都会从眼中涌出，但你能透过鲜血视物。透过鲜血本身看见一切。 Blood pours from your eyes, blinding you for d4 turns. You feel that if your hands were covered in blood before casting the spell you would be protected. In reality the blood will pour from your eyes either way, but you'll be able to see through it. See through the blood itself.
8	你的指甲向后翻卷并从指尖撕裂。新的指甲似乎在原处结晶，但在其硬化期间，接下来的d2小时内进行任何体力检定均需承受-1减值。 Your fingernails roll back and tear from your fingertips. New ones seem to be crystallising in their place, but take -1 to any physical rolls for the next d2 hours while they harden.
9	在你的皮肤上随机d4个位置爆发出厚厚的黄色水泡。其中的脓液恰好高度易燃。 Thick yellow blisters erupt in d4 random locations on your flesh. The pus inside happens to be highly flammable.
10	当你施法时，蠕虫从你的血肉中钻出，它们的嗓音升腾成格里高利圣咏，与你的声音交织共鸣。 Worms emerge from your flesh, their voices rising in a Gregorian chant to accompany your own as you cast the spell.
11	你失禁了。这并不雅观，但事实如此。咒语吟唱的某种共鸣让你感到不适，50%的情况下，排泄物只是脆弱的昆虫空壳。 You void your bowels. It isn't pretty but there it is. Something in the resonance of the spell's chanting doesn't sit right with you anymore, 50% of the time it's nothing but fragile discarded insect shells.
12	嗜血之渴。除非你饮用血液，任何类型的血液，否则每10分钟暂时减少1点生命值。若生命值降至零，获得随机疯狂并投掷变形表。 Bloodthirst. Until you drink blood, any kind of blood, temporarily decrease your HP by 1 every 10 minutes. If your HP reach zero gain a random insanity and roll on the transmutation table.
13	法术过后，出现长腿悬垂的无翅飞虫。若通过魔法豁免，它们不会察觉你；若法术施于活物，它们将落在其上，溶解其脚下的血肉，造成等同于法术等级的伤害。若豁免失败，它们会被你吸引，轻轻落在你的皮肤上，你无法触碰它们，它们将看似头部的部位贴近你的肌肤，发出愉悦的嗡鸣。每法术等级投掷d4，从你的灾厄池中扣除相应数值。 Insects with long, hanging legs that fly without wings appear in the wake of the spell. If you save vs. Magic they don't notice you, and if the spell was cast on a living being they will land on them, dissolving cones of flesh beneath their feet dealing damage equal to the spell's level. If you fail they are drawn to you and land softly on your skin, you can't touch them, they press what you assume to be their heads to your flesh and emit a pleasant humming. Roll d4 per level of the spell and remove that from your Cataclysm pool.
14	从你体内升起的黑色光束如热浪般涌向周围人的眼睛。10英尺内的任何人必须通过毒素检定，否则智力提升1点并获得随机疯狂症状。 Beams of dark light rise from your body like heat waves, seeking the eyes of those around you. Anyone within 10' must save vs. Poison or gain 1 Intelligence and a random insanity.
15	每次施法时，你脖子上的甲状腺肿都会扩大。若其被刺破或切除，内部将发现一个与肿物大小相应发育阶段的软白色真菌版施法者。 A goitre expands on your neck and grows every time this spell is cast. If it is ever burst or cut off a squishy white fungal version of the caster at a stage of development equal to its size will be found inside.
16	你的肋骨从胸膛中裂开，撕裂盔甲，将躯干劈开，内脏喷涌而出，悬浮在你面前，血管和血肉在它们与敞开的胸腔之间拉扯，宛如奇异路线图上的城市。一回合后，过程逆转，仿佛从未发生，但你需要d4回合才能重新站起。每次发生，景象都略有不同，你无法确切指出，仿佛有什么缺失，有什么被改变了。 Your ribs open up out of your chest, tearing through armour and splitting your torso open as your internal organs spray out and hover in front of you, veins and gore string between them and the open cavity of your body, making them look like cities on a bizarre roadmap. After one round the process reverses and seals like it never happened, but it will be d4 rounds before you're able to stand up. Every time this happens it looks different somehow, you can't place it, it's almost as if something is missing, as if something has been altered..
17	你感到腹部一阵剧痛。仅主持人可见：投掷2d4，结果为孕育期。当法术再被施放相应次数后，施法者将不得不排出体内逐渐增大的胆结石。排出过程耗时孕育期的一半回合数，施法者需在掷骰时加上孕育期数值，并掷出低于其体质的点数。若失败，胆结石在碎裂的同时撕裂施法者的生殖器官，造成孕育期一半的伤害。若成功，胆结石完整排出，其表面光滑，颜色难辨，部分区域如完美切割的宝石尖塔，另一些则形成奇异反光的气泡。若施法者有意，可将其用作导管，获得等于孕育期的加值，且最低完整度为50。 You feel a sharp pain in your abdomen. Referee only: roll 2d4. This is the Gestation. Once the spell has been cast that many more times the caster will have no choice but to pass the gallstone that has been growing inside them. It takes half as many rounds as the Gestation, and requires the caster to roll under their Constitution with Gestation added to the roll. If they fail it tears their genitals apart even as it breaks itself to pieces, and deals half as much damage as the Gestation. If successful the gallstone is passed intact. Its surface is glassy and of no discernible colour, with sections that shoot off in perfectly cut gem spires and others formed of strangely reflective bubbles. If the caster thinks to do so it can be used as a Conduit with a bonus equal to its Gestation and a minimum Integrity of 50.
18	你身体随机部位长出三英寸长的毛发，实为有感知的真菌。若试图移除，未剪断的毛发会引发剧痛，需花费d4轮时间剪除，每轮持续造成1点伤害。若置之不理，这些毛发有50%几率在一天内最多一次于不当时刻释放致幻孢子。 Three inch long hairs which are actually sentient fungi grow from a random location on your body. If you try to remove them, the uncut hairs inflict a debilitating pain which requires d4 rounds to finish cutting them off and deals 1 damage per round you persist. If left alone, the hairs have a 50% chance of releasing hallucinogenic spores at inconvenient times a maximum of once per day.
19	你开始分泌一种病态的甜味物质。带翅昆虫仿佛从你周围的空气中闪烁而出，它们苍白的珠光甲壳只有在停落你皮肤上吸食时才变得清晰。每轮你试图驱赶它们时，它们会蜇你造成1点伤害，若已被蜇过一次，则每次后续蜇刺需进行麻痹豁免，否则失去身体控制权d4轮。一旦你不再干扰，它们将在d4轮内完成进食。你可在它们进食时移动，但任何剧烈活动如攻击都会招致它们的猛烈蜇刺。 You start sweating a sickly sweet substance. Winged insects seem to shimmer out of the air around you, their pale opalescent carapaces only becoming clear when they settle on your skin to feed. Every round you try to get them off they will sting you for 1 damage, if you have already been stung once save vs. Paralysation after every subsequent sting or lose bodily control for d4 turns. Once they are left alone they will finish feeding in d4 rounds. You may move around while they are feeding, but any strenuous activity like attacking will cause them to sting the hell out of you.
20	你的左臂血肉变得松软如海绵（想象《来自异界》中的普雷托里斯博士；“若你愿意，触碰我吧…”）。每次施放此法术，有10%的几率使状况恶化。1. 皮肤变酸且粘稠。2. 手臂部分开始变黑。3. 手臂完全变黑。4. 指甲脱落，手臂不断渗出并滴落清澈的黄色液体。5. 血肉似乎失去完整性，长时间击打或握持物品后常会留下部分血肉，但无痛感，且你永远看不到缺失的部分。6. 血肉沸腾蠕动，黑色小手从中伸出，脓疱破裂，血肉从手臂下方脱落，如酸液般灼烧地面，一张面孔在你翻腾的血肉中形成，无声地尖叫“停下”，随后一切结束。7. 你目睹四道裂痕沿手臂从手掌延伸，血肉撕裂、渗出，并向上卷曲成四瓣直至肩部，随后脱落至地面。你凝视着玻璃般透明的手臂骨骼及其中狂暴的黄色雾气，它低语着无法理解的话语，刺耳的噪音迫使所有人跪地，在耳鸣中你感到玻璃骨骼碎裂。当你睁开眼，雾气已消散，而你丢弃的血肉正用孩童般的手抓向你，无声地无尽尖叫。 The flesh of your left arm becomes spongy and pliable (think Dr. Pretorius in From Beyond; “Touch me, if it pleases you..”). Every time you cast this spell there is a 10% chance of the condition progressing. 1. The skin turns sour and sticky. 2. The arm begins to turn black in places. 3. The arm turns utterly black. 4. The fingernails fall off and a clear yellowish fluid constantly sweats and drips out of the arm. 5. The flesh seems to be losing its integrity, parts of it are often left on things you have struck or held too long, but it's painless, and you can never see where it's missing. 6. The flesh bubbles and writhes, small black hands reach out of it, boils pop and flesh falls from beneath your arm, burning the floor like acid, a face forms in the midst of your churning flesh and seems to silently scream “stop”, and then it's over. 7. You watch as four lines split down the length of your arm starting at your hand. The flesh tears and oozes and rolls back up your arm in four quarters until it reaches your shoulder and sloughs to the floor. You stare at the glassy bones of your arm and the violent yellow mist coursing through them, it whispers something you can't comprehend, a piercing noise forces everyone to their knees and in the ringing you feel the glass bones shatter. When you open your eyes the mist is gone and your discarded flesh is clutching at you with the hands of children, screaming endlessly without a voice.
