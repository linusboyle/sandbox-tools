1d20	疯狂
1	这是谁的手臂？你坚信自己的一只手臂不属于你。你会撕咬它，直到将其移除。 Whose arm is this? You are convinced that one of your arms does not belong to you. You will tear and bite at it until it is removed.
2	你发现一只异常巨大的腐烂老鼠。你扯下它的头，蛆虫从眼中掉落，然后继续前行。自此，你无法再做出任何决定而不先向神圣的“虫首”请示。 You find a surprisingly large rotting rat. You tear its head off, maggots falling from its eyes, and go on your way. You can no longer make a decision without consulting the divine Verminhead.
3	你坚信黑暗是一种实体，会进入你的口中吞噬你的呼吸，直到你的肺化为尘土。他们绝不可能让你熄灭提灯，不管他们以为自己听到了什么动静。 You believe darkness is an entity that will enter your mouth to feed on your breath until your lungs turn to dust. There's no way they can make you put out your lantern, doesn't matter what they think they hear coming.
4	食粪癖。 Coprophagia.
5	你坚信自己的血液有限。受伤时，你会对攻击者暴怒，获得等同于所受伤害的命中与伤害加成，直至对方死亡。之后，你会花费同等回合数试图将他们的血液舀入你的伤口。 You believe your blood is finite. When wounded you fly into a rage against your aggressor, gaining a bonus to hit and damage equal to the damage they dealt you until they are dead, after which you spend an equal amount of rounds trying to scoop their blood into your wounds.
6	猫是肮脏的间谍，正密谋着你的谋杀。该死的毛茸茸的畜生！ Cats are filthy spies. Plotting your murder. Damn their furry hides!
7	随机选择一位同伴，你深信他们是一种人形寄生虫。你不想让他们知道你已经察觉，但会不遗余力地向其他人证明这一点。 Pick a random companion, you become convinced that they are some kind of parasite in the shape of a man. You don't want them to know you're on to them just yet but you will go to great lengths to prove this to everyone else.
8	雨水让你恐惧，它像酸液一样灼烧你！ Rain terrifies you, it burns you like acid!
9	你坚信自己是一只寄居蟹，将这副躯体当作外壳。如果它受损，你只需换一个新的。 You believe you are a hermit crab, wearing this body like a shell. If it's damaged you'll just get a new one.
10	你拒绝再剪任何指甲，无论是手指还是脚趾。你拒绝向任何人解释原因。如果它们断裂，你会变得歇斯底里。 You refuse to cut your nails ever again. Finger or toe. You refuse to tell anyone why. If they break you become hysterical.
11	科塔尔综合症。你相信自己已经死亡并在腐烂，不明白同伴如何能忍受这股恶臭。有15%的几率你会相信自己是不朽的。 Cotard's syndrome. You believe you are dead and rotting, you're not sure how your companions can bear the stench. 15% chance that you believe you are immortal.
12	夜惊症。 Night terrors.
13	他们要害你，他们知道你的秘密，他们想让你死！偏执占据心头，你将周围每个人都视为敌人，导致精神错乱的暴力行为。好好睡一觉或被击昏后，你就能恢复正常。 They're out to get you, they know your secrets, they wish you dead! Paranoia takes hold and you see everyone around you as an enemy with psychotically violent results. You'll get over it after a good sleep or being knocked unconscious.
14	你身边始终漂浮着一颗病态肥胖猪的无头头颅，其眼窝中塞满了大石块代替眼睛，一颗腐朽的金色桂冠悬于脑后。它与你交谈，十分友善。每当它开口时，蛆虫从它口中掉落，金色叶片则从断颈处飘落。 You are constantly accompanied by the floating decapitated head of a morbidly obese pig. Large stones are jammed into its sockets in place of eyes and a decaying golden laurel hovers behind its head. It speaks to you, it's really quite friendly. When it does, maggots fall from its mouth and golden leaves from its severed neck.
15	你深信若将自己涂满泥浆和粪便，并让同伴们朝你吐口水，就能在大多数生物眼中隐形。第一次失效时，你会惊愕不已，心想肯定是他们吐得不够用力。 You're convinced that if you cover yourself in mud and faeces and have your companions spit all over you you will be invisible to the naked eye of most beings. You'll be fucking shocked the first time it doesn't work, they mustn't have spit hard enough.
16	你无法忍受他人的触碰，认为他们试图与你的肉体融合。 You can't stand to be touched by others, you think they're trying to meld with your flesh.
17	你坚信书籍会反过来阅读你。每当读完除法术书以外的任何书籍后，你都会将其焚烧，以防它向他人泄露你的秘密。 You believe that books read you back. After you finish reading anything other than your spellbook you will burn it to prevent it telling your secrets to others.
18	进入未曾尝过的建筑时，你必须趴下舔舐地板，否则将在d4回合内陷入恐慌。 When entering a structure you haven't tasted before you need to get down and lick the floor or you'll freak out in d4 turns.
19	你在所有能触及的皮肤上刻下交叉的三角形。这大约需要一小时，你拒绝做其他任何事，直到完成。若被强行拖走，你会踢打咒骂，直到他们放开你，让你继续。你告诉同伴这是为了防止坠入无墙之室，并强烈建议他们也这样做。 You carve crossed-out triangles into every bit of skin you can reach. I takes about an hour, you refuse to do anything else until you're finished, if you're dragged away you'll kick and curse until they release you so that you can continue. You tell your companions it is to protect from falling into the room without walls, you strongly suggest they do the same.
20	你在同伴熟睡时开始收集他们的头发、指甲和死皮。如果他们流血，你会尽可能收集一些。这一切都用于秘密建造你那腐烂的神球。他们不会理解的。 You start collecting hair, nails, and dead skin from your companions while they sleep. If they bleed you will scoop some up if you can. It all goes towards the putrid godball you're building in secret. They wouldn't understand.
