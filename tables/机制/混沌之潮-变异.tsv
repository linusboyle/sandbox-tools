1d20	混沌之潮-变异
1	你的双腿变得肥胖且粉红，双脚则如冻伤般发黑。当脚上的肉脱落时，它们变得像猪蹄一样分叉。你发现自己腹部现在有三排肿胀的乳头。两只有着猪般手指的肥胖、柔软的手臂逐渐从臀部上方长出。将这两只手臂视为忠诚度为7的随从，每次你想用它们做某事时，需进行忠诚度检定，否则你只会呕吐在自己身上。 Your legs become pudgy and pink and your feet turn black like frostbite. When the flesh sloughs away from your feet they are cloven like a pig's. You discover you now have three sets of distended teats lining your stomach. Two pudgy, pliable arms gradually grow from just above your hips, if a pig had fingers they would look like this. Treat the arms like a retainer with a loyalty of 7, any time you want to do something with them make a loyalty roll, otherwise you just throw up on yourself.
2	你的下颌脱臼，喉咙像袋子一样垂下。你的下颌现在依靠超弹性肌腱铰接，喉咙可以像鹈鹕或青蛙一样伸缩膨胀。 Your jaw dislocates and your throat dangles like a crop. Your jaw now hinges on over-elasticised tendons and your throat can stretch and swell like that of a pelican or frog.
3	你的肩膀与颈部交界处冒出d4个坚硬的小结节。它们不断生长并扭曲成坚硬的棱角状角，仿佛在你脑后形成了一副病态的笼状领子。一个月内，这些角会长到约3英尺长，但它们的生长不会停止。若施法者想到将其研磨成细粉，这些角将成为极佳的施法材料。 d4 small hard nodules push out of your shoulders around the base of your neck. They continue to grow and twist out into hard, ridged horns, like some kind of morbid cage collar behind your head, within a month they're about 3 feet long, but they won't stop there. They make an excellent spell component when ground into a fine powder if the caster ever thinks to do so.
4	你的眼窝内及周围长出明亮的橙色海葵触手，包裹住你的双眼。在光亮中，你能通过触手尖端的小黑点正常视物；在黑暗中，你能感知周围50英尺内的环境。 Luminous orange anemone fronds grow in and around your eye sockets, engulfing your eyes. You can see normally in light (from the small black dots at their tips), and in darkness you can sense your surroundings within 50'.
5	在接下来的两周内，你的鼻子将变成数百颗小种子状滑腻肉块的理想孵化环境，犹如辣椒内部。若不每日采集这些种子，你很可能成为鸟类和啮齿动物的目标。 For the next 2 weeks your nose becomes an ideal environment for the incubation of hundreds of small seed-shaped slippery tags of flesh, like a capsicum. If the seeds aren't harvested daily you are likely to become a target for birds and rodents.
6	你身体的随机位置长出一张嘴。大部分时间它只是大声呼吸并试图咬靠近它的任何东西，但一旦你说谎，它就会大喊出真相。 A mouth grows from a random location on your body. For the most part it just breathes loudly and tries to bite anything that comes near it, but as soon as you tell a lie it will yell the truth.
7	你的腹肌在接下来的一周内剧烈痉挛，同时一条螺旋线从你的肚脐处形成。沿此线的皮肤坏死脱落，你获得了控制两根弹性、带硬齿触须的能力，它们从你的腹部扭曲而出，固定在肚脐下方的肉上。你的器官似乎覆盖了一层新的绿色薄膜以抵御感染，但在触须展开时，器官却失去了其他保护。 Your abdominal muscles cramp terribly for the next week while a line forms in a spiral from your navel. The skin along this line dies and falls away and you gain control of two elastic hard-toothed tentacles which twist themselves out from your stomach, anchored to the flesh below your navel. Your organs seem to have a new greenish film over them to ward off infection, but are left otherwise unprotected while the tentacles are unfurled.
8	你额外长出一对乳房，无论你原本是否已有。这对乳房不断渗出苦味的琥珀色液体。你总在黑暗中醒来，发现一些柔软的小生物正用明亮的眼睛从你身上吸食。 You grow a set of breasts in addition to any you may have already. These breasts constantly leak a bitter smelling amber fluid. You keep waking up with small soft crawling things with bright eyes feeding from you in the dark.
9	你身体的某个随机部位开始肿胀，并逐渐覆盖上一层细密的粘性丝线，最终形成一个网状的肿块。纯白的飞蛾不断在其周围飞舞，若将其遮盖，下方的皮肤会如同被千只蚂蚁啃咬般灼痛。肿块不时会破裂，释放出带有黑色青铜甲壳的凶猛幼体。 A random part of your body begins to swell, and fine layers of sticky silk thread develop over it until it is no more than a webbed mound. Delicate pure white moths constantly fly in and around it, if you cover it the flesh beneath burns as if being bitten by a thousand ants. Every now and then it will burst to release the aggressive black-bronze carapaced young.
10	你无法停止流下黑色胆汁。它对除你自身血肉外的一切物质都呈弱酸性。若你呕出一滩胆汁，其中会涌现出眼睛并在翻腾的液体中爆裂。 You can't stop drooling black bile. It seems to be mildly acidic to everything but your own flesh. If you regurgitate a pool of it eyes emerge and pop amongst its surging mass.
11	鼠母。你喉咙两侧鼓起厚厚的腺体，按压时会分泌出刺鼻的黑色油脂。雌鼠被你吸引，形成一个保护性的母性群体。 Rat Mother. Thick mounded glands swell from the sides of your throat, when pressed they secrete a pungent black grease. Female rats are drawn to you, forming a protective maternal coven.
12	你的骨骼液化，身体变得像章鱼一样柔软。每当你想恢复人形时，需进行魅力检定。若失败，你会像《机械战警》中埃米尔·安东诺夫斯基撞入有毒废料后的模样。若成功，你看起来则像《300勇士》中更臃肿的埃佛尔。强行恢复人形会带来痛苦，受到1点伤害。 Your bones liquefy and you find your body as pliable as an octopus. Whenever you want to pull yourself back into a solid human form roll under Charisma. If you fail you look like Emil Antonowsky after he crashes into toxic waste in Robocop. If you succeed you look like a lumpier Ephor from 300. Forcing yourself back into a human form hurts, take 1 damage.
13	你背部的皮肤变得多孔且富有弹性，并长出数千个厚实的干皮赘。你的舌头现在能延伸至3英尺长，并分泌某种油脂，你发现自己会舔舐背部以缓解干燥的疼痛。 The skin of your back becomes porous and elastic and you sprout thousands of thick dry skin tags. Your tongue can now extend 3 feet in length and sweats some kind of oil, you find yourself licking your back to relieve the dry pain.
14	身体多处出现半透明的牡蛎状角质增生。一周后，这些增生足以提供+1的护甲等级。若将其切开，有50%的几率喷出黑色墨汁，如辣椒般灼伤攻击者的眼睛。在检查或切开时，有5%的几率发现一颗价值100银币的黑珍珠。 Vaguely translucent oyster-like keratin growths appear in multiple places on your body. After a week there are enough to grant you +1 AC. If split open there is a 50% chance of them squirting black ink which burns like chilli into the eyes of the aggressor. When inspecting or splitting them open there is a 5% chance of revealing a black pearl worth 100sp.
15	你身体随机部位长出短小的肉质茎，顶端结有粉红色纹理的球体。在极度紧张时，这些球体会爆炸成紫色花朵，释放出白色死皮孢子云。你会立即感受到无形之物在茎部区域疯狂舔舐，之后你的感知变得敏锐，搜索检定获得+1加值。一周内，茎会在新位置重新长出。随着时间的推移，你将学会控制孢子，但希望永远不会看到那些跟随你以获取营养的存在。 Short fleshy stalks bearing pink textured globes grow from a random location on your body. In times of extreme stress these globes explode into violet flowers in a cloud of white dead-skin spores. You immediately feel the sensation of being wildly licked by multiple tongues over the stalked area by something you cannot see, but afterwards you feel a heightened sense of things, gaining +1 to any search rolls. Within a week the stalks will regrow in a new location. Over time you will learn to control the spores, but hope you never see the things following you for nourishment.
16	数百根六英寸长的蓝色触须从你的下颌延伸至喉咙，它们渴望着鲜血。 Hundreds of blueish 6 inch long tendrils grow below your jaw and down your throat. They thirst for blood.
17	你的双眼沸腾爆裂，手臂和双手的皮肤裂开，新的眼睛如蛙背上的卵泡般冒出。你的突袭和搜索检定提升1点。 Your eyes boil and burst and the skin of your arms and hands splits as new eyes bubble out like eggs on a frog's back. Your Surprise and Search rolls improve by 1.
18	掷d6：1. 你的右臂。2. 你的左臂。3. 你的右腿。4. 你的左腿。5. 你的腹部。6. 你的整个身体在接下来的d6小时内被剧痛折磨。随着时间的推移，身体部位淤青变黑，血肉开始扭曲并发出尖叫。最终，身体部位变得像一棵扭曲烧焦的树，短而摇曳的肉须从你的血肉中冒出并摇摆。血肉处于不断变化的状态，肉须缩回并在其他地方出现，你的皮肤凹陷、扭曲和膨胀，一个树洞状的空洞会出现并低语着难以理解的话语。任何被这血肉触碰的人必须进行毒素豁免，否则会陷入歇斯底里。如果你的整个身体受到影响，魅力减少d6，智力增加，但夜晚会有东西对你低语。 Roll d6: 1. Your right arm. 2. Your left arm. 3. Your right leg. 4. Your left leg. 5. Your abdomen. 6. Your entire body is racked with agonising pain for the next d6 hours. As this time progresses the body part bruises and turns black and the flesh begins to twist and scream. By the end the body part resembles a gnarled burnt tree, and short wavering tendrils of flesh of various lengths emerge and sway from your flesh. The flesh is in a constant state of change, the tendrils retract and appear elsewhere, your skin sinks and twists and inflates, a knot hole will appear and whisper something incomprehensible. Anyone touched by this flesh must save vs. Poison or lapse into hysterics. If your entire body was affected decrease Charisma by d6 and add to Intelligence, but something whispers to you in the night.
19	在靠近骨骼坚硬部位，尤其是肘部、胫骨、肩膀和脊椎的皮肤上出现凹槽状孔洞。一群玻璃般紫色的蚁状生物在你的骨骼内安家，以骨髓为食。你的生命值永久减少1点。每当你受到物理攻击时，有50%的几率这些蚂蚁会从你体内飞出攻击侵略者，且有25%的几率它们既攻击又开始治愈伤口，每两轮恢复1点生命值。 Fluted holes appear in your skin near hard areas of bone, particularly your elbows, shins, shoulders and spine. A colony of glassy purple ant-like creatures takes residence inside your bones, feeding on the marrow. Your HP are permanently reduced by 1. Any time you are physically attacked there is a 50% chance the ants fling themselves from your body to attack the aggressor, and a 25% chance that they both attack and begin to mend the wound, restoring 1HP every 2 rounds.
20	在接下来的一周里，你腿部和腹部的血肉逐渐剥落。腹部消融，显露出淡黄色的分节甲壳，孔洞中摇曳着触须，胸部下方展开黏滑的操纵臂。最终，你的胸膛腐烂殆尽，露出两侧脉动的裸露器官，围绕着一道隆起的胸骨，你尚不清楚它们的用途。双腿腐烂后仅剩变色的骨骼，最终在你体重下分解坍塌。取代你腹股沟和臀部的短节肢与触须群，使你移动速度不减反增，甚至可能更快。 Over the next week the flesh sloughs away from your legs and abdomen. Your belly falls away to reveal a pale yellow segmented carapace, wavering tendrils emerge from holes and slimy manipulator arms unfurl below your chest. Eventually your chest rots away to reveal two pulsing uncovered organs on either side of a ridged breastbone, you're not yet sure what they're for. Your legs reveal nothing but discoloured bone as they rot, eventually decomposing and collapsing beneath your weight. The mass of short segmented legs and tendrils that have taken the place of your groin and buttocks allow you to move as fast as you ever did, maybe even faster.
