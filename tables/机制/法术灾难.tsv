"1d40"	"法术灾难"
1	"十二只手沿着你的躯干排成一线，将你的肉体像舞台帷幕般拉开。当你望向那黑暗，仿佛穿越隧道，直至看见自己被百根牛脂蜡烛照亮，站在一幅巨大画布前，手持画笔，描绘着当前的场景。那些锯齿状、分节的灰色腿脚正从你躯干的洞中伸出，越来越长、越来越多，如同一只拥有千足的巨大蜘蛛，你不断描绘它们向外延伸。你的同伴们面露恐惧，你画下其中一人跪地，向一个他们从未知晓的神祇祈祷。你画下最亲密的朋友恍然大悟的表情，意识到这是万物的终结，这生物将腐蚀世界，啜饮残骸。当你画下越来越多的腿脚从你的肉体帷幕中拖曳而出时，你也有了同样的觉悟。如今腿脚太多，已无法全部描绘，你能感受到它们在画布上，穿透一切，但主体尚未显现，尽管你感到它已不再需要你的画笔帮助来穿越。你仍在作画，而你知道时间所剩无几。 A dozen hands push out in a line down your torso, drawing back your flesh like a stage curtain. When you look into the darkness it's like going through a tunnel until you reach yourself illuminated by a hundred tallow candles, standing before an enormous canvas, brush in hand, painting the present scene. The jagged, segmented grey legs pulling themselves through the hole in your torso are getting longer and more numerous, like a great spider with a thousand legs, you keep painting them growing further and further out. Your companions look terrified, you paint one fallen to their knees, praying to a god they have never known. You paint a look of realisation on your closest friend, that this is the end of all things, that this creature will rot the world and drink the remains. You have the same realisation as you paint more and more legs dragging themselves through your curtain of flesh. There are too many legs to paint over now, you can feel them on the canvas, they penetrate through all things, but the body has not yet emerged, though you feel it no longer needs the help of your brush to pull itself through. You are still painting, and you know that time is running out."
2	"下次队伍醒来时，会发现施法者如茧般紧贴床铺，一只手伸出侧边，仿佛期待被握住。若有人触碰那只手，会感到一阵刺痛，随后手便枯萎缩回硬壳内。未通过毒素豁免者，下次睡眠时亦将遭遇相同命运。或许你并不想等待，看看最终会从茧中孵化出什么。 The next time the party wakes they will find the caster crusted to their bedding like a chrysalis, their hand sticking out the side like it is expecting to be held. If anyone touches the hand they feel a sting before it shrivels back inside the crusted shell. Save vs. Poison or the same happens to you the next time you sleep. You may not want to wait to find out what will eventually hatch from the cocoon."
3	"施法者下次入睡时，受伤的哀怨者会在梦中显现。她褐色的头发无力地垂在脸上，薄薄的白披肩滑落在地，露出三对下垂的乳房。她的腹部和大腿布满了疤痕组织，小腿、脚踝和手腕上有着绳索勒痕般的环状印记。她请求施法者吮吸她的乳汁。若施法者为女性，则被邀请成为她的子宫之一。若施法者拒绝成为子宫，则选择一个乳房或掷骰子：1（左上）。若为女性，施法者怀孕。若为男性，施法者触碰的下一位女性将怀上他们的孩子。孩子将成长为极具影响力的人物，同时也是一个隐秘的杀手。2（右上）。施法者腹部不断长出鲜艳粉红色菌盖、荧光黄绿色菌褶的真菌，其内部菌丝体现在维持着施法者的生命，不再需要进食。这些蘑菇本身剧毒，饮下者将死于知识。3（中左）。施法者的嘴唇与哀怨者的乳房融合，这是最令人安心的体验。哀怨者将永远怀抱并哺育他们。4（中右）。施法者目睹哀怨者的真实面容，从此余生都在尖叫，直至喉咙鲜血淋漓、嘶哑不堪。5（左下）。施法者饮下自己的血液和母亲的乳汁，逐渐干瘪成一具枯槁的躯壳。6（右下）。无论性别，施法者立即开始分娩哀怨者的真正子嗣。当婴儿从任一孔道露出头部时，其身体如同痛苦之梨般裂开，撕裂施法者，其中蠕动咆哮的噩梦血肉开始哭泣，渴求第一餐，并猛烈攻击周围的一切。生命骰等于施法者等级。 The next time the caster sleeps, the Wounded Wretch appears to them in a dream. Limp brown hair hangs over her face and she lets her thin white shawl drop to the floor, revealing three sets of pendulous breasts. Her belly and thighs are a mess of scar tissue and rings like rope burn decorate her calves, ankles and wrists. She asks the caster to suckle her. If the caster is female they are invited to become one of her Wombs. If the caster doesn't agree to become a Womb choose a breast or roll d6: 1 (Top Left). If female, the caster becomes pregnant. If male, the next woman the caster touches becomes pregnant with their child. The child will grow to be a highly influential figure. And a secret killer. 2 (Top Right). Fruiting bodies with vibrant pink caps and fluorescent yellow/green gills continually grow from the caster's stomach, the fungal mass within now sustains them and they no longer need to eat. The mushrooms themselves are incredibly poisonous, killing the imbiber with knowledge. 3 (Middle Left). The caster's lips meld to the Wretch's breast and it is the most comforting thing imaginable. The Wretch cradles and feeds them for all time. 4 (Middle Right). The caster sees the Wretch's true face and screams, until their throat is bloody and raw, for the rest of their life. 5 (Bottom Left). The caster drinks their own blood and fluid from the mother's breast, shrivelling into a dried husk. 6 (Bottom Right). Regardless of gender the caster immediately begins birthing a true child of the Wretch. As the baby crowns from whichever orifice it is using its body opens like a Pear of Anguish, tearing its way through the caster, and the writhing snarling mass of bubbling nightmare flesh within begins to cry for its first meal, lashing out at anything nearby. HD equal to the caster's level."
4	"从施法者肩膀和颈部刺出细长的白色铁钉，悬挂着电线、脊线和环，形成一个精致的晕轮。悬浮其中的面孔无声地喋喋不休，小人们行走在悬挂的桥梁上，争论着审判、刺击和交媾。有50%的几率，晕轮的居民判定施法者值得，留下并为其“掷骨”或“宇宙导管”掷骰提供d4加值。否则，一位美丽的大理石女子从施法者头顶升起，双臂优雅地高举，缓缓放下，轻轻舔舐身上的血液和脑浆，如小鹿饮叶上露珠，随后俯身将双臂插入施法者的瞳孔，使其倒地胡言乱语。宛如克里斯·库克西的雕塑。 Thin white iron spikes with hanging wires and ridges and rings pierce outwards from the caster's shoulders and neck in an elaborate halo. Faces suspended within the mess chatter noiselessly and tiny men and women walk around on hanging bridges debating judgement and stabbing and rutting amongst themselves. 50% chance the denizens of the halo judge the caster worthy, remaining with them and providing a d4 bonus to any Cast the Bones or Conduit of the Cosmos rolls. Otherwise a beautiful marble woman rises through the crown of the caster's head, her arms delicately held above her in a classical pose, lowering them to softly lick the blood and brain matter from her body like a faun drinking dew from a leaf before leaning down and pushing her arms through the pupils of the caster's eyes, leaving them in a gibbering mess on the floor. It's like a Kris Kuksi sculpture."
5	"地面融化为一片无光的白光表面，声音引发柔软的尖刺如均衡器上的条形物从地面弹起，附着于噪音源头。脚步声回荡并包裹你的双腿。沉默是金。（若有敌人在场，裁判应让其中一人尖叫并冲向施法者。尖刺从地面跃起，高至视线之外，当尖刺回落时，一个无特征纯白身影，黑点作眼，立于原地，无论你如何移动，它都凝视着你。） The ground melts into a surface like white light without a glow, sound causes soft spikes like bars on an equaliser to bounce out of the ground and cling to the source of the noise. Footsteps echo and coat your legs. Silence is golden. (If there are enemies present the Referee should have one yell and run at the caster. Spikes leap out of the ground so high that you lose sight of them, when the spikes retreat back into the ground a featureless pure white figure with black pinholes for eyes is standing in their place. Turning to stare at you wherever you move.)"
6	"施法者的头颅撕裂开来，血泉从其跪伏的身躯中喷涌而出。血液浓稠粘腻，变幻出令人惊异的色彩，溅洒并蔓延至屋顶，其中潜藏着未知之物。它们以断裂的关节伸展而出，随后瘫软在地，重组为另一种形态，诞下吞噬自身的生物，带着咕噜般的尖啸向你爬来，随后如倒放的水滴般浮向屋顶。你或许该封上门了。 The caster's head shreds open and a fountain of blood towers out of their kneeling body. The blood is thick and viscous and shifts into surprising palettes of colour, it splatters and spreads across the roof, there are things in it. They reach out with breaking joints before slopping to the floor and reforming as something else, they give birth to things which consume them and crawl towards you with a scream that is a gurgle then float to the roof like a drop of water watched in reverse. You should probably seal the door."
7	"一团滴淌的、闷燃的黑色污泥吞噬了你的心脏，在你的胸膛上烧出一个洞。你依然活着。当你造成伤害时，污泥会吞噬一半的生命值，若你受伤，这些生命值也会转移给你。它变得更大、更热，从你的胸腔溢出，拍打着你的腹部。当你受到伤害时，污泥会相应减少。当它达到25点生命值时，开始渴求更多的鲜血与杀戮，若在战斗中暴露，会自行发起一次d8攻击。若达到50点生命值，它将包裹并缓慢消化你的身体，同时再生你的血肉，像魔法裂变反应堆一样利用你，为其疯狂的杀戮狂欢提供能量。 A dripping ball of smouldering black sludge consumes your heart, burning a hole through your chest. You still live. When you deal damage the sludge consumes half the Hit Points, also transferring them to you if you are wounded. It grows bigger and hotter, slopping out of your chest cavity and slapping against your stomach. When you take damage the sludge is diminished by an equal amount. When it reaches 25HP it begins to beg for more blood, more carnage, making a d8 attack of its own if exposed in combat. If it reaches 50HP it will envelop and slowly digest your body while regenerating your flesh, using you like a magical fission reactor to power its hysterical killing spree."
8	"海洋。当你受伤时，你的身体会涌出盐水而非血液，地板上蠕动着你从未想象过的微小透明生物和鲜艳的甲壳类动物。如果你被杀死，你的身体将爆裂并释放出海洋。 The Ocean. When you are wounded your body gushes saltwater instead of blood, tiny translucent organisms and vibrant crustaceans you never imagined writhe about on the floor. If you are killed your body will burst and release the ocean."
9	"一切陷入黑暗，你失去了对墙壁的感知，同伴们围在你身边，双眼闪烁着白光，他们撕扯着你的血肉，狼吞虎咽，连咀嚼都顾不上，只为了填饱肚子。你的反击如同穿过影子般无法触及他们。最终，你的同伴们围坐在你最后站立的地方，腹部鼓胀，双手和嘴巴沾满鲜血。施法者唯一的遗存是一颗蜡封的头颅，静静地摆在他们中间。 Everything goes dark, you lose sight of the walls, your companions are around you with shining white eyes, they rend and tear at your flesh, stuffing their mouths, not even chewing in their haste to fill their bellies, your attempts to fight back pass through them like a shadow. Your companions find themselves sitting in a circle around the place where you last stood with distended bellies and blood soaked hands and mouths. The only remaining trace of the caster is a wax-sealed skull sitting in their midst."
10	"蛇类孵化坑。你的喉咙扩张，它们开始从你口中滑出，你的腹部裂开，成堆的蛇滑落至地面，幼崽从它们的子宫中滑出，几乎一出生就迅速成年，随即又产下自己的后代，它们在地板上蜿蜒爬行，形成一团不断扩张的扭动肉体与鳞片。（血液如红宝石般鲜红，它们的钻石鳞片似乎从肉体表面隆起，其间流淌着细小的沟壑。若被咬伤需进行对抗毒素的豁免检定。4d20小时后，你将遭遇同样的命运。它们的繁殖会在填满一个30英尺见方的房间后停止。一天后，它们会硬化成真正的红宝石。若将其打碎，一条小蛇会从中掉落，整个过程将重新开始。） Snake birthing pit. Your throat expands and they begin to slide out of your mouth, your stomach splits open and piles of them slop to the floor, offspring slime out of their wombs and reach adulthood almost as fast as they are born, in turn giving birth to their own young, they slither across the floor in an ever expanding pile of writhing flesh and scales. (Blood ruby red, their diamond scales seem raised from the surface of their flesh, tiny valleys running between them. If bitten save vs. Poison. In 4d20 hours you'll share the same fate. They'll stop birthing after they've multiplied enough to fill a 30' room. After a day they harden into actual ruby. If you break them a baby snake falls out and the process starts all over again.)"
11	"你的肉体膨胀成紫色的肿块，成为长腿甲虫的巢穴，这些甲虫似乎是在滑行而非爬行。你的意识现在寄居于这些甲虫之中，而非你那已成废墟的躯体。为你的身体创建一个独立的HP列表，其最大初始HP为6（根据LotFP规则）。你无法再被治愈。只要甲虫未被消灭，它们将以每周1HP的速度繁殖，并以每天1HP的速度修复身体。如果甲虫完全离开身体，分泌新身体的时间将延长三倍，或者它们可以感染一具尸体并以正常速度转化。当甲虫离开身体时，它们的AC仅为10，但对除范围攻击外的所有伤害只承受一半。你是一个意识分裂成多部分的存在，当部分甲虫损失时，你的思维会变得紊乱和困惑。每损失1HP的甲虫，智力就会下降，最低降至6，直到甲虫重新繁殖。 Your flesh bubbles into bulbous purple mounds, becoming a hive for long-legged beetles which seem to glide rather than crawl. Your consciousness now resides in the beetles, not your ruined hive of a body. Create a separate HP listing for the body with maximum starting HP (6 by LotFP). You can no longer be healed. As long as the beetles aren't wiped out they will repopulate at 1 HP per week, repairing the body at 1 HP per day. If the beetles abandon the body entirely it takes 3 times as long to secrete a new one, or they can infest a corpse and convert it at the normal rate. When outside a body the beetles only have AC10 but take half damage from anything other than area attacks. You are a single consciousness split into many parts, when part of you is lost your thoughts become erratic and confused. Intelligence is decreased for every HP of beetles lost, down to a minimum of 6 until the beetles repopulate."
12	"暴雨从地面倒灌向天空。若你在室内，天花板会形成一滩晃荡的水池，d4轮后，色彩变幻的带刺触须从中伸出，每存在一个生物便有一条触须，它们会寻找下方目标，以18的力量进行擒抱，若被抓住需进行麻痹豁免。若被拉入水中，海洋在蓝色黑暗中延伸至你永远无法触及的远方，针孔般的星光在你周围游动舞蹈，你只感到平静，被卷入那吞噬大部分视野的色彩与意识的漩涡中。若你在室外，头顶会形成一团色彩变幻的旋涡云，d4轮后，云中闪现脑电火花，雨点携带着盘口大小的白化兵蟹落回地面，每存在一个生物便有d4只，它们的手代替了钳子。若被它们的手抓住需进行麻痹豁免。它们爬上你的胸膛，贴近你的脸，用那可怕的口器说话，向你揭示宇宙的所有秘密。你的大脑仿佛被浇上酸液，你将永远无法记住任何内容。智力减半（向下取整），并将失去的数值加到感知上。 Heavy rain begins to fall from the floor into the sky. If you're inside, a pool of sloshing water forms in the ceiling, and after d4 rounds pastel colour-shifting spined tentacles emerge and seek those below, one for every being present. They grapple with 18 Strength, save vs. Paralysation if they take hold. If they pull you into the water the ocean stretches in blue darkness further than you will ever see, constellations of pinhole lights swim and dance all around you and you feel nothing but calm as you are pulled into the swirling mass of colour and sentience that engulfs most of your vision. If you're outside, a swirling pastel colour-shifting cloud forms overhead, and after d4 rounds sparks of brain-lightning flash inside its mass and the rain begins to fall back to earth, carrying plate-sized albino soldier crabs with hands instead of claws, d4 per being present. Save vs. Paralysation if they get their hands on you. They crawl onto your chest and lean into your face, speaking from their terrible mouths. They tell you all the secrets of the cosmos. Your brain feels like someone is pouring acid on it and you will never remember any of it. Halve your Intelligence, round down, and add the amount you lost to Wisdom."
13	"施法者的一只眼睛从头部弹出，一条深红色的蛇从眼窝中滑出，口中衔着那只眼睛。蛇盘绕并昂首，凝视着周围的人。他们脑海中响起干叶般的低语，询问他们有何愿望。蛇所实现的每个愿望都会使施法者的生命值减少1点，但这并不明显，除了他们空荡的眼窝中不断涌出的鲜血。如果施法者的生命值降至0，他们将倒下，摔碎成尘埃。在施法者失去的生命值对应的周数之后，蛇所赐予的一切都将化为鲜血，无论是字面意义还是象征意义。 One of the caster's eyes pops from their head and a crimson serpent slithers from the socket holding the eye within its mouth. The serpent coils and rears up, staring at those around it. The dry leaf whisper in their minds asks them what they wish of it. Any wish granted by the serpent decreases the caster's HP by 1, but this isn't obvious aside from the growing flow of blood from their empty eye socket. If the caster reaches 0HP they fall and dash against the ground into a pile of dust. After a number of weeks has passed equal to HP lost by the caster anything bestowed by the serpent will turn to blood, either literally or figuratively."
14	"数小时后，起初缓慢地，你腹部的肉开始向内扭曲。它持续搅动，直到在你的肋骨与腹股沟之间形成一个螺旋状的隧道，从正面看似乎延伸至少30英尺进入体内。隧道扭曲的肉散发出微弱的蓝光，尽头只见缕缕黑暗的触须。你感受到对刚死之物的饥饿幻痛。任何新近被杀的血肉放入螺旋中，都会被轻柔地吸入，沿着隧道漂浮直至消失在黑暗中，不久后，十枚无法追溯年代的古老金币从你的腹部叮当落地。一旦400枚金币出现，体内之物对血肉祭品感到满足，宿主的身体被拉伸、翻转，围绕螺旋隧道向后卷曲，形成不断扩大的、尖叫着的畸形肉卷，黑暗触须被拉近表面，直至爆发，充满房间的蓝光血肉与黑暗，以启蒙腐蚀心智与躯体。附近任何人的肉体都会爆发出难以想象的、不断变化的新形态，而他们的意识则膨胀至无法触及的层次，同时作为人的一切内爆。接下来的一个小时内，这种影响向四面八方辐射900英尺，之后，该范围内所有生命将消失，只留下少数被升格所拒的无心智怪物。 Hours later, slowly at first, the flesh of your stomach begins to twist inwards. It continues to churn into your body until a spiralling tunnel gapes between your ribs and groin, seen from the front it seems to extend at least 30' into your body. The twisting flesh of the tunnel emits a faint blue glow, and at the end nothing can be seen but whispy tendrils of darkness. You feel phantom stomach cramps of hunger around the recently dead. Any recently killed flesh placed within the spiral is drawn gently inward and floats along its length until it disappears in darkness, and soon afterwards d10 gold coins of an antiquity no one can place clatter out of your belly. Once 400 coins have emerged, the thing inside is satisfied with the flesh offerings and the host's body is stretched and turned and curled backward around the spiral tunnel, forming grotesque screaming ever widening rolls of flesh as the tendrils of darkness are drawn ever closer to the surface until it erupts and fills the room with glowing blue flesh and darkness, corrupting minds and bodies with enlightenment. The flesh of anyone in the immediate vicinity erupts in unimaginable constantly changing new forms while their minds expand into unreachable levels of consciousness even as everything they were as a person implodes. Over the next hour this influence radiates a further 900' in all directions, after which every living thing in that sphere will disappear, save for a few mindless abominations apparently rejected from ascendancy."
15	"另一个赤裸的你从你身上剥离，滑落在地，就像一张照片从另一张上移开，脓液和膜状物在你们之间拉出丝线。有50%的几率这个赤裸者实际上是施法者。如果施法者被杀而另一个未被消灭，在游戏结束后告知玩家他们是谁。如果允许另一个留在队伍中，他们会比以往任何时候都更友好，并对展现出真正友谊兴趣最大的人表现出坚定不移的忠诚。一旦他们交到了真正的朋友，他们会想要一直陪伴在朋友身边，某晚当朋友在他们身旁安睡时，他们的下巴会脱臼并伸展，试图将朋友整个吞下。 Another, naked you falls away from you to the floor, like a photograph being moved away from another, strands of pus and membrane string between you. There is a 50% chance that the naked one is actually the caster. If the caster is killed and the Other is not, inform the player after the session who they are. If the Other is allowed to stay with the party they will be friendlier than ever, and will become steadfastly loyal to whoever shows the most interest in a true friendship. Once they have made a true friend they will want to be near them always, and one night while their friend sleeps by their side the Other's jaw will dislocate and stretch, and they will try to swallow their friend whole."
16	"你升入空中，d4条肢体自行撕裂脱离你的身体。血肉撕裂，肌腱断裂，你眼睁睁看着这些肢体在半空中溶解，仿佛被消化一般，随后你摔落在地。 You lift into the air and d4 limbs tear themselves away from your body. Flesh rips and tendons snap, you watch as the limbs dissolve in mid air as if being digested before you drop to the floor."
17	"每当入眠，有人呼唤着你，他们需要你，去寻找他们，你在水边停下，他们近在咫尺，他们需要你，走进水中……接下来的两周，每晚你都会在蓝月映照的水边恢复意识，即便入睡时附近并无水源，需进行魔法豁免以抵抗踏入水中的冲动。每晚你都更接近他/她/你所认为最具吸引力之物，直至在晨光中湿漉漉地醒来。第六夜，当你步入水中，他们将拥你入怀，用半透明的针鼹牙齿在与你缠绵时吞噬你的血肉。 Someone is calling to you when you sleep, they need you, go find them, you stop by the water, they're so close, they need you, go into the water.. Every night for the next 2 weeks you come to your senses next to the blue moonlit water, even if there was no water nearby when you went to sleep, save vs. Magic to resist stepping in. Every night you get closer to her/him/whatever you find most attractive before waking up soaking wet in the morning light. On the 6th night you enter the water they will embrace you and consume your flesh with translucent echidna-quill teeth while making love to you."
18	"你总在余光中瞥见一道阴影，但转身时却无影无踪。一旦有机会让你独处，这潮湿灰暗的影分身便会试图杀死你。它渴望成为你，真正的你。它拥有与你相同的能力值，能幻化出你手中物品的阴影版本，且护甲等级+2，它几乎无形，却渴望改变这一点。它更倾向于不伤害你，而是用拳头扼住或掐死你。若影分身成功杀你，它会撕开你，吞噬你的器官，然后蠕动进它新的肉体——你的新肉体。在你适应新身体时，重新掷骰决定能力值。技能、法术和记忆将被继承。 You keep seeing a shadow in your peripheral vision but when you turn it's never there. As soon as it can get you alone this damp ashy shadow doppelgänger will try to kill you. It wants to be you. The real you. It has the same Ability Scores as you, gains a shadow version of any item that you take in your hand, and has +2 AC, it's mostly incorporeal, and it wants to change that. It would rather not injure you, preferring to strangle or choke you with its fist. If the doppelgänger kills you it will split you open and eat your organs before wiggling into its new flesh. Your new flesh. Re-roll your Ability Scores while you get settled into your new body. Skills, spells and memories are inherited."
19	"对抗毒素检定。若成功，接下来的2d6轮内呕吐出卵囊。否则，恭喜！你已怀上神肉。你渴望与所有人分享这份祝福，尤其是你的朋友。在他们熟睡时。 Save vs. Poison. If successful spend the next 2d6 rounds vomiting up an egg sac. Otherwise, congratulations! You are now pregnant with godflesh. You want to share this blessing with everyone. Especially your friends. While they sleep."
20	"对抗魔法豁免。若成功，施法者受到2d4点伤害并获得随机疯狂。否则，在本次游戏结束后告知玩家，他们的意识已被吞噬，并被潜伏恐惧的投射意识所取代。从此，他们将继续协助队伍的目标，但会竭尽全力将队伍引向恐怖实体的所在。 Save vs. Magic. If successful the caster takes 2d4 damage and a random insanity. Otherwise, after the session inform the player that their consciousness has been consumed and replaced by the projected consciousness of a lurking fear. From now on they will continue to assist in the party's goals, but do their best to draw them towards the horror's physical form."
21	"你变得炽白如焰，随后爆炸，对50英尺内所有目标造成每角色等级d6点伤害 You turn white hot, then detonate, dealing d6 damage per character level to everything within 50 feet"
22	"你已被大地所唾弃。施法范围内100英里内的所有动物都将竭尽全力杀死你。 You have been spurned by the Earth itself. All animals within 100 miles of casting will do their best to kill you."
23	"你将依次施放d10个随机法术，从最低法术等级到最高法术等级，每个法术的目标也是随机的。这些法术仍会消耗环位，并且你必须如常进行极限施法检定。 You will cast d10 random spells in sequence, one right after the other, from lowest spell level to highest spell level, with random targets. These still use Cataclysm points, and you must Cast the Bones as normal."
24	"你融化成了一滩清澈的水，深不可测，黑暗的影子在深处搅动。它们看起来并不友好。 You melt into a puddle of clear water. It is impossibly deep, and dark shapes can be seen stirring in its depths. They don’t seem very friendly."
25	"一切陷入黑暗。如果你或你的盟友设法制造光亮，它也是闪烁而微弱的。黑暗中充斥着歌声，伴随着柔软的手和苍白的面孔。 Everything goes dark. If you or your allies manage to produce a light, it is flickery and tenuous. The darkness is filled with singing things with soft hands and pale faces."
26	"该区域立即从更大的现实中分离，如同面团被掐断。你有一小时的时间找到返回的方法，否则这个半位面将与某个“他处”的现实融合。 The immediate area pinches off from greater reality like a piece of dough. You have an hour to find a way back or this demiplane will join up with a reality Somewhere Else."
27	"某位主神或灵体注意到了你的魔法使用，并宣布你为禁忌。所有与你的承诺、义务和契约均告无效，任何援助你者将被视为教会之敌。该神祇的天使/大天使/灵体现身，试图摧毁你及你的盟友。 Some major deity or spirit has noticed your magic use and declared you anathema. All promises, obligations, and contracts with you are now void, and anyone who aids you is considered an enemy of the Church. An angel/archon/spirit of said deity appears and tries to destroy you and your allies."
28	"你得知一个邪恶灵魂贿赂了你的一个队友；如果他们杀了你，他们将立即获得一个经验等级。 You know that a malign spirit has bribed one of your party members; if they kill you, they will gain an experience level immediately."
29	"你的影子版本诞生了。它的属性与你相反。如果你的某项属性为3，影子版本的则为18；若你为13，影子版本则为7。它渴望杀死你，并愿意为此进行长期谋划。 A shadow version of you is born. Its attributes are the opposite of your’s. If you have a 3 in an attribute, the shadow version’s is 18; if you have a 13 in an attribute, the shadow version’s is 7. It wants to kill you, and it is willing to play the long game to do so."
30	"你完全静止不动。当盟友检查你时，发现你其实是空心的，皮肤和头发只是一层薄如纸的外壳。若外壳破裂，会喷出极其强力的酸液。 You are perfectly, perfectly still. When your allies examine you, they see that you are actually hollow, and that your skin and hair are part of a paper thin shell. If it is broken, incredibly powerful acid jets out."
31	"你手中握着一支粉笔，在最近的平面上画了一扇门。这扇门真实存在，通向某种洞穴。你走进去后便再也没有出来。你的同伴们能听到门后传来滑行的声响。 There is a piece of chalk in your hand. You sketch a door on the nearest flat surface. It is real, and leads into some sort of cave. You walk in and do not come out. Your allies can hear slithering noises from beyond the threshold."
32	"你瘫倒在地，当场死亡，所有已知法术同时爆发。 You slump to the ground, dead, and all of your known spells go off at once."
33	"你唤醒了死者。所有墓地、陵园、地窖中的亡者都被释放出来。 You have awakened the dead. All graveyards, necropoles, crypts let loose the interred."
34	"你回到1级。一个由可用材料制成、生命骰数等于失去等级的傀儡被激活，并试图杀死一切。 You lose all Cataclysm points. A golem, animated from the available materials and with a number of HD equal to Cataclysm points lost, comes to life and tries to kill everything."
35	"施法者周围五英里半径内的区域，阳光无法照耀。此地陷入一片巨大的黑暗之环中。 The sun does not shine on anything in a 5 mile radius of the caster. The exist in a great circle of darkness."
36	"脚下裂开一道小缝，你能感受到热气从中升腾。这是火山的开端，它将以每分钟50英尺的速度增长，直至山体大小并喷发。快跑。 A small cracked opens up beneath your feet. You can feel heat rising up from it. It is the beginnings of a volcano, and will rise height by 50 feet a minute and erupt when it is mountain sized. Run."
37	"你变成了一只猫。请重新创建角色。 You are now a cat. Roll a new character."
