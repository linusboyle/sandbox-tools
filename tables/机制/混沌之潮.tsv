"1d40"	"混沌之潮"
1	"[[混沌之潮-深渊]]。不仅此效果现在发生，而且今后每次施放此法术时都会触发。 Roll on Abyssal Side-Effects. Not only does this effect happen now, but every time you cast this spell from now on."
2	"[[混沌之潮-变异]]。 That's new... Roll on Transmutation table."
3	"一块腐烂的金色偶像凭空融化并悬浮在区域中央。在场的所有人，包括动物和非人怪物，均需掷3d6。掷出最高者随机一项能力值提升1点，最低者则降低1点相同能力值。掷出18者可许愿，需再次掷骰，若低于13则愿望灾难性失败。掷出14者眼中涌出价值500银币的金色蛆虫。掷出10者获得随机疯狂症状。掷出6者永久脱落毛发、指甲和牙齿。掷出3者痛苦倒地，巨大水泡从其肉体中膨胀并破裂，释放出介于龙虾与鱿鱼之间的泥橄榄色生物，其肉体逐渐变为相同的泥橄榄色，生物将其吞噬，最终整个场景化为恶臭的泥浆。 A rotting golden idol melts out of thin air and hovers in the centre of the area. Everyone present rolls 3d6, including animals and inhuman monsters. Whoever rolled highest increases a random ability score by 1. Whoever rolled lowest loses 1 from the same ability score. Anyone that rolls: 18 may make a wish. Roll again. If you roll less than 13 it goes horribly wrong. 14 has golden maggots to the value of 500sp wriggle out of their tear ducts. 10 gains a random insanity. 6 permanently sheds their hair, nails and teeth. 3 collapses in agony as enormous blisters swell from their flesh and burst, releasing mud-fleshed olive green creatures somewhere between a lobster and a squid, as they writhe on the ground their flesh turns the same mud olive and the creatures consume them before the whole scene collapses in a reeking puddle."
4	"一只尖叫的无毛猎犬显现，它用粉红色的肉手剖开自己的肚子，然后将内脏献给你。与此同时，它那无牙的嘴一直发出尖叫。 A screaming hairless hound manifests, it disembowels itself with fleshy pink hands, then offers you its entrails. Screaming all the while from its toothless maw."
5	"你开始剧烈地哭泣，却不知原因。任何在你哭泣时看着你的人都能看到你头顶上滴血的圣光环。 You start violently weeping and you don't know why. Anyone looking at you while you weep can see a dripping halo of blood over your head."
6	"每次想从法术书中阅读内容时，需进行对抗魔法装置的豁免检定。若失败，你只能读到一份简写记录，内容是关于你所有个人缺点的描述，笔迹出自你一生中最珍视之人。 Save vs. Magical Device every time you want to read something from your spellbook. If you fail all you can read is a shorthand account of all your personal shortcomings in the hand of whoever you have held most dear in life."
7	"施法者的意识与随机一名敌人的意识互换，若无敌人存在，则与一只从地底爬出的腐烂粉红色人形蟾蜍怪互换。施法者保留其施法能力。 The caster's mind switches place with that of a random enemy, or if no enemies are present, that of a man-sized putrid pink anthropomorphic toadbeast that claws its way out of the ground. The caster retains their spellcasting abilities."
8	"施法者周围30英尺内弥漫着腐烂卷心菜的气味。进行毒素豁免检定。未通过者会颤抖出汗，如同发烧一般，并在接下来的d4回合内变得性欲失控（各自单独掷骰）。 The scent of rotting cabbage wafts through the air within 30' of the caster. Save vs. Poison. Those who fail shake and sweat as if with a fever and become sexually uncontrollable for the next d4 turns (each rolls separately)."
9	"施法者口中喷出淡绿色雾气，随即昏迷d8轮。在此期间，玩家可操控雾气。无法交流，以轻度负重速度移动，可扩散至30英尺半径，如普通雾气般受环境影响。吸入雾气者须通过毒素检定，否则肺部液化而亡。 A pale green mist billows from the caster's mouth and they lose consciousness for d8 turns. During this time the player may control the mist. They cannot communicate, move at a Lightly Encumbered rate, can expand to fill a 30' radius, and are affected by things as a normal mist would be. Anyone who breathes in the mist must save vs. Poison or die as their lungs liquefy."
10	"30英尺内的所有人开始感到皮肤发痒，仔细观察会发现毛孔不断扩张和收缩，仿佛有东西在其中穿行。此时，皮下有东西在蠕动并带来灼烧感。若有人挖开皮肤，会发现指甲大小的闪亮蓝绿色水母状生物，其触须会硬化成玻璃针般。经过d6轮后，瘙痒停止，水母消失。 Everyone within 30' begins to feel an itching in their flesh, and if they look closely they will notice pores stretching and closing as if something was moving through them. Something is now moving beneath the skin and it burns. If anyone digs into their flesh they will discover shimmering turquoise things like jellyfish the size of fingernails, but with tentacles that harden like glass needles. After d6 rounds the itching stops and the jellyfish disappear."
11	"你跪倒在地，呕吐出（掷d8）：1. 充满挣扎黑蟹的绿色藻类。2. 冒泡的水，你听到低语和孩童般的笑声，气泡膨胀并破裂。3. 一条长着人脸的黄金鳗鱼。4. 一只怀孕肿胀的老鼠，落地时腹部裂开，幼崽四散。5. 一滩粗糙的焦油。一个多面拼图盒在池中央缓缓显现，它似乎并非从地面升起，而是焦油从它周围下沉。你无法确定它有多少面，总是数不清。你无法想象它是如何通过你的嘴，更不用说喉咙。6. 血液、眼睛、牙齿和头发，如同爆裂的肿瘤。7. 文字。不是写在纸上，也不是图案，只是文字。它毫无意义，旁人只见呕吐物，而你吐出文字。它告诉你你将如何死去。但你无法阅读，字句无法理解，它们不断移动，你试图抓住它们，但它们从指间滑落，你深知这些文字揭示了一切。要是你能读懂就好了。8. 八枚金币。若用这些金币购买物品，当晚使用金币的人会梦到收下金币的人。空气中弥漫着丛林大火般的黑雾，熔化的黄金从他们的脸上流下，可能填满他们的嘴、眼窝，从耳朵涌出……他们怀着疯狂的愤怒渴望杀死你，你曾伤害他们，为何要伤害他们？若你在梦中杀死他们，醒来时你将满身鲜血和脑浆，站在他们的床上，他们的头颅已不复存在。反之亦然。 You fall to your knees and regurgitate (roll d8): 1. Green algae filled with struggling black crabs. 2. Bubbling water, you hear whispers and childlike laughter as the bubbles expand and burst. 3. A golden eel with the face of a man. 4. A bloated, pregnant rat whose belly splits open when it hits the floor, spilling its young. 5. A pool of gritty tar. A multi-sided puzzle box is slowly revealed in the centre of the puddle, it doesn't appear to emerge from the floor, more like it remains still and the tar sinks down from its sides. You can't be sure of how many sides, you always seem to lose count. You have no idea how it fit through your mouth let alone your throat. 6. Blood. And eyes and teeth and hair. Like a burst tumor. 7. Writing. Not on paper, not in patterns, just writing. It doesn't make sense and nobody else can see anything but vomit but you regurgitate writing. It tells you how you die. But you can't read it, the words won't make sense, and they keep moving, and you try to hold them down but they slip through your fingers, but you know that the writing tells you everything. If only you could read it. 8. Eight gold coins. If these coins are used to buy something, that night the person who used the coin will dream of the one they gave it to. The air is nothing but bushfire-black fog, and molten gold runs from their face. It might fill their mouth, their eye sockets, pour from their ears.. They desire to murder you with a psychotic rage, you wronged them, why did you wrong them? If you kill them in your dream you will wake up covered in blood and brain matter, standing on their bed in what used to be their head. And vice versa."
12	"施法者体内长出一株植物。每周有一晚，d3根干燥的黑色藤蔓从其孔窍中伸出，结出光泽饱满的深紫色果实。果实中心有一个蜷缩成胎儿姿势的小型黑色多肢人形，质地与果实相同。若施法者行为不端，果实甜美，可增强力量、敏捷与智力，但有25%几率上瘾；若施法者行为端正，果实尝起来如灰烬与盐，引发极度偏执与嫉妒。 A plant grows in the caster's stomach. One night per week d3 dry black tendrils emerge from the caster's orifices and bear glossy plump deep purple fruit. In the centre of the fruit is a small black multi-limbed figure in a foetal position, of the same consistency as the fruit. If the caster has been acting immorally the fruit is sweet and grants increased Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence, with a 25% chance of addiction. If the caster has been acting morally the fruit tastes of ash and salt and induces extreme paranoia and jealousy."
13	"施法者所穿戴的一切*有50%的几率（掷d6）：1. 分解成一群咕咕叫的石灰绿色蜘蛛，用它们的小肢轻抚你。2. 变成玫瑰色玻璃，反射出扭曲的景象。3. 变得柔软湿润，下次触碰时会与皮肤融合。4. 化为恶臭的粉尘，在原地旋转几分钟后重组，再次化为粉尘，如此循环。5. 像浓稠的油漆般泼洒到地上。6. 变成某种你从未见过的野兽毛发，部分还带着头皮碎屑，小虱子在其中四处游动。*背包算作一件物品，但里面重要的物品需单独掷骰。 Everything the caster is wearing* has a 50% chance of (roll d6): 1. Decomposing into a swarm of cooing lime green spiders which caress you with their tiny limbs. 2. Turning into rose-coloured glass that reflects things all wrong. 3. Becoming pliable and moist. It will fuse to your skin the next time you touch it. 4. Puffing into a foul smelling dust which swirls in place for a few minutes, then reforms, then puffs into dust, and so on. 5. Splashing to the ground like thick paint. 6. Turning into hair from some kind of beast you've never seen before, some parts still have bits of scalp attached and tiny lice swarm throughout. *Packs count as one item but anything important inside gets its own roll."
14	"一只狗跑进区域，如果你正在攻击某人，它会立即扑向他们。他是最可爱、最忠诚的小狗，是的，就是他。其他人看到它时，会发现它的皮毛在颤抖，而它的头裂开，里面的猴头骨对着他们尖叫。 A dog runs into the area, if you were attacking someone it immediately latches onto them. He's just the cutest most loyal little dog ever yes he is. Anyone else that looks at it sees its fur shivering and shaking while its head splits open and the monkey skull within screams at them."
15	"施法者呕吐出一只巨大的粉色蟾蜍，它大声鸣叫后化为一滩黏液。接下来的3小时内，所有在听觉范围内的人若想说话，必须通过毒素豁免，否则会呕吐出一只小粉蟾蜍，它会盯着并跟随他们。其背上的疙瘩不断渗出黑色液滴。若主动舔舐，有3/6的几率治愈你，否则你将幻觉发作，持续回合数等于你的掷骰结果，并有10%的几率获得随机疯狂。 The caster vomits forth an enormous pink toad which croaks loudly and collapses into a puddle of slime. For the next 3 hours everyone who was within earshot must save vs. Poison when they wish to speak, otherwise they vomit up a small pink toad which stares and follows them. The bumps on its back constantly sweat beads of black fluid. If you actively lick one there is a 3 in 6 chance it cures you, otherwise you hallucinate for a number of turns equal to your roll, with a 10% chance of gaining a random insanity."
16	"黑血沸腾。施法者的力量提升至18，并陷入杀戮狂怒。他们所受的任何伤口都会立即喷溅出酸性沸腾的黑血。每轮有50%的几率，施法者会从眼中喷射血液，作为10英尺的远程攻击，同时进行其他动作。此效果持续d8轮，之后施法者将昏迷相应小时数。 Black Blood. The caster's Strength increases to 18 and they fly into a murderous frenzy. Any wound they sustain immediately sprays acidic boiling black blood. Every round there is a 50% chance the caster sprays blood from their eyes as a 10' ranged attack in addition to their other actions. This lasts for d8 rounds, after which the caster blacks out for that many hours."
17	"施法者视线范围内的所有人必须进行魔法豁免检定。未通过者开始从口中分娩，包括脐带和胎盘。胎儿即为他们自身。若杀死胎儿则无任何后果，若允许其存活，胎儿将每日吸取其一年寿命，使其明显衰老。若食用胎儿，随机一项能力值增加1点。胎儿存活每多一日，此效果重复一次。 Everyone within view of the caster must save vs. Magic. Those who fail begin to give birth through their mouths, umbilical cord and placenta and all. The foetus is them. If they kill it there are no consequences, if they allow it to live it will leech a year of their life every day, growing visibly older. If they eat the child, increase a random ability score by 1. Do this again for every day the child has lived."
18	"你的嘴唇仿佛从未存在过般紧闭，舌头似乎增大了一倍，在口腔中四处游移，感觉还在不断膨胀，试图让你窒息。若你咬断舌头，会发现口中满是长着黑腿的蛆虫，而你的嘴唇其实从未紧闭。有50%的几率你真的咬断了舌头。 Your lips seal shut like they never existed and your tongue seems to double in size, it's moving around your mouth and feels like it's getting bigger, it's trying to choke you. If you bite your tongue in half you'll find that your mouth is full of black, legged maggots, and your lips were never sealed shut. 50% chance you really did bite your tongue in half."
19	"罪恶灯塔。他人在你周围难以抑制禁忌欲望。接下来的d6周内，你身后将留下一连串乱伦与私刑的痕迹，若骰出6则永久持续。 Beacon of Sin. Others find it hard to repress taboo desires around you. A trail of incest and lynchings is left in your wake for the next d6 weeks, with 6 being permanent."
20	"施法者周围5英尺半径内的一切都液化成一滩恶臭的橙色脓液，包括地板、他们的头发以及他们穿戴的所有物品。研究施法者已掌握的法术只需通常时间的一半。完全被该区域笼罩的生物有50%的几率在液化成脓液后仍保留其意识。 Everything in a 5' radius around the caster is liquefied into a foul-smelling orange pus. Including the floor, their hair, and everything they are wearing. Researching spells the caster had already learned only takes half as long as usual. There's a 50% chance that living beings completely caught in the sphere will retain their sentience despite liquefying into pus."
21	"成千上万只蝙蝠 Thousands and thousands of bats"
22	"重力在d6轮内重新定向；骰子6点所指的方向即为新的下方。 Gravity is reoriented for d6 rounds; whichever way the 6 is pointing is the new down."
23	"太阳逐渐消失，化作一只巨大的红边眼睛，持续至日落。无论你身处何处，室内、地下或失明，都能感受到它的凝视。这独眼巨人的注视让你充满负罪感；每小时一次直至日落，你必须进行对抗麻痹的豁免检定，否则需花费一回合描述10件你尚未提及的恶行。 The Sun fades away, becoming an immense red rimmed eye for the rest of the day. You can see it staring at you no matter what, even if you are inside or underground or are otherwise blinded. The Eye’s cyclopean regard fills you with guilt; once an hour every hour until sunset, you must Save vs Paralysis or spend a turn describing 10 terrible thing you have done that you have not yet described."
24	"满月升起并开始歌唱。动物变得凶猛且狡诈，疯子变得暴力并擅长逃脱，君主开始策划入侵，普通民众陷入恐惧、偏执和绝望。潮汐变得混乱而极端。持续2d4周。 The full Moon rises and begins to sing. Animals begin to act aggressively and with vicious cunning, madmen become violent and adept at escape, monarchs begin to plot invasion, and the general populace is driven to fear, paranoia, and despair. The tides are erratic and extreme. Lasts 2d4 weeks."
25	"星辰在天空中骤然闪耀后消失。夜间导航变得不可能，道路迷失方向，洋流引向陌生的海域。持续2d4周。 The Stars flare to life in the sky, then vanish. Navigation by night becomes impossible, roads lead astray, and currents lead .to strange seas. Lasts 2d4 weeks."
26	"施法者开始以每小时5年的速度衰老。当他们达到100岁时，便会死亡，一个婴儿从其衣袍中爬出。婴儿继续以相同速度成长，直至20岁。同一角色，保留相同记忆。 The caster begins aging 5 years an hour. When they reach 100 years, they die, and an infant crawls from their body’s clothing. It continues to age at the same rate until it reaches 20. Same character, same memories."

28	"你的双手从手腕处脱落并迅速爬走，新的双手在原处生长。在这一天剩余的时间里，每当你施放法术，同样的事情都会发生。这些手保持活动状态直到被摧毁，并会尽其所能制造可怕的恶作剧。 Your hands detach from your wrists and scuttle away, and new hands grow in their place. For the rest of the day, every time you cast a spell, the same thing happens. The hands remain animate until destroyed, and will do their best to make terrible mischief."
29	"你将花费d6轮时间咳出一颗闪亮的黑色果实。若你食用它，将再花费2d6轮咳出两颗果实。若他人食用，他们的眼球会翻向脑后，并做出预示灾难的预言。 You spend d6 rounds coughing up a glistening black fruit. If you eat it, you spend 2d6 rounds coughing up two more fruit.
