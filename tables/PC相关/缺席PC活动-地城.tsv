1d20	缺席PC活动-地城
1	角色不慎跌入深坑或陷阱，必须攀爬回地面以获自由。玩家需进行敏捷检定。若检定失败，敏捷增加1点，但受到3d6+3点伤害；若检定成功，则安然无恙地爬回地面。 The character fell into a deep pit or pit trap, and they had to climb back up to freedom. The player must make a Dexterity check. If the check fails, their Dexterity increases by 1 but they suffer 3d6+3 damage. If check succeeds, they climb back up unscathed.
2	角色遭到了一群与队伍上次遭遇同类的怪物伏击并被俘虏！他们夺走了角色携带的所有金币和财宝，随后将其释放。 The character was ambushed and taken prisoner by a group of monsters of the same type as the party last encountered! They took all the gold and treasure the character had with them and then set them free.
3	角色不慎跌入深坑或陷阱。在重新加入队伍之前，他们可能不得不面对一只游荡怪物（依据所处地牢的标准遭遇概率）。 The character fell into a deep pit or pit trap. Before they rejoin the party, they might have to face a Wandering Monster (standard chances for the dungeon they were in).
4	角色触碰了墙上一个微小的闪亮符文，被传送到了他们上次睡过的床上！ The character touched a tiny, brilliant rune on the wall, and was teleported to the last bed they had slept upon!
5	角色跌入了一个坑或陷阱，必须竭尽全力挣脱。玩家需进行力量检定。若失败，力量增加1点，但受到1d3+1点伤害；若成功，则受到1点伤害。 The character fell into a pit or pit trap, and they had to use all their strength to break free. The player must make a Strength check. If they fail, their Strength increases by 1 but they suffer 1d3+1 damage. If they succeed, they suffer 1 damage.
6	一位来自异界的强大法师召唤了这位角色，参与一项辉煌的冒险！他们对那段经历记忆模糊，只记得熔岩荒原和无法带回这个位面的珍宝。此外，他们随身携带的任何酒精饮品都已消失无踪。 A mighty wizard from another plane summoned the character to take part in a glorious quest! They don’t remember much, except the burning lava wastes and the treasures they could not carry over to this plane. Also, any alcoholic beverage they had with them is now gone.
7	角色尝了一块看似奶酪的东西，直到现在才恢复意识。幸运的是，在他们昏迷期间没有任何东西吃掉他们。玩家必须进行一次感知检定。如果失败，他们的感知将增加1点。 The character tasted something that looked like cheese, and they’ve only regained consciousness now. Luckily, nothing ate them while they were unconscious. The player must make a Wisdom check. If they fail, their Wisdom increases by 1.
8	角色发现了一瓶药剂，不慎饮下后昏迷，刚刚苏醒。玩家需用4d6重新掷一次随机能力值（最高18）。经裁判裁定，此效果可通过某种治疗手段（如解除魔法或移除诅咒法术）消除。 The character found a potion and carelessly drank it. They passed out and have only recovered now. The player must reroll a random ability score with 4d6 (maximum result 18). At the referee’s discretion, this effect can be canceled with some kind of treatment (e.g. a dissolve magic or remove curse spell).
9	一只极度近视的腐尸爬行者误将角色认作自己的后代。它麻痹了角色并将其带回巢穴，满怀爱意地用垃圾喂养他们。 An extremely short-sighted carcass crawler mistook the character for one of its offspring. It paralyzed them and took them to its lair, where it lovingly fed them with garbage.
10	角色必须通过对抗麻痹的豁免检定，否则失去1点敏捷。从此，他们对尸体爬行者造成的麻痹免疫，并且对所有其他来源的麻痹豁免检定获得+2加值。 The character must save versus paralysis or lose 1 point of Dexterity. From now on they are immune to paralysis caused by carcass crawlers, and they add +2 to all saves versus paralysis from any other source.
11	角色在拐角处瞥见一道诡异的幻影，被魔法般吸引着追随它。那是一位在此丧命的冒险者的幽灵！通过幻象，灵魂向他们警告了地牢中潜伏的巨大威胁。 The character saw an eerie apparition behind a corner, and was magically lured to follow it. It was the ghost of an adventurer who died here! The spirit has warned them through a vision about a great threat in the dungeon.
12	角色留下解读涂鸦，揭示了关于地牢的线索（由裁判决定）。 The character remained behind to decipher a graffiti, which revealed a clue about the dungeon (at the referee’s discretion).
13	角色被一群精灵绑架，他们教会了角色老鼠的语言！ The character was kidnapped by a group of sprites, who taught them the language of mice!
14	角色推动了一块砖或石头，墙壁旋转后他们发现了一条通往隐藏宝藏的秘密通道：1d100枚铂金币，并有50%几率获得一件随机魔法物品！随后他们花了数小时试图再次打开这条秘密通道。 The character pushed a brick or rock, the wall rotated and they found a secret passage to a hidden treasure: 1d100 platinum pieces and 50% chance of a random magic item! Then they spent hours and hours trying to open the secret passage again.
15	角色发现一枚硬币卡在两块石头之间，于是留下来试图取出。玩家需进行一次力量检定。若失败，角色的力量增加1点；若成功，角色获得1金币！ The character found a coin stuck between two stones, and remained behind to recover it. The player must make a Strength check. If they fail, the character’s Strength increases by 1. If they succeed, the character gains 1 gp!
16	角色在两块石头间发现了一枚硬币，决定留下来取回它。玩家需进行力量检定。若检定失败，力量提升1点；若成功，则发现那并非硬币，而是一枚随机魔法戒指！ The character found a coin stuck between two stones and remained behind to recover it. The player makes a Strength check. If the check fails, their Strength increases by 1. If the check succeeds, they discover it was not a coin after all, but a random magic ring!
17	玩家必须编造另一个故事，因为所发生之事必须保密。角色触碰了一个小符文，现被囚禁其中，而其邪恶双胞胎则被释放。玩家现在扮演邪恶双胞胎（拥有相同的游戏数据），直到双胞胎被杀死或被发现。实际角色仍能获得玩家应得的经验值，每杀死一个有感知的生物还可额外获得10%的奖励（请注意，这不必是其他玩家的角色，因为他们作为盟友可能更有用……直到他们发现真相）。当邪恶双胞胎死亡或被识破时，原角色从魔法符文监狱中释放，但必须在此表上掷两次，并在“荒野最后所见”表上掷一次。 The player must make up another story, because what has happened must remain a secret. The character touched a small rune, and is now imprisoned inside it, while their evil twin came out. The player now plays the evil twin (which has the same game statistics), until the twin is slain or discovered. The actual character still receives the experience the player would gain, plus a 10% bonus for each sentient creature it manages to kill (please note it doesn’t have to be the other players’ characters, as they are probably more useful as allies... until they find out). When the evil twin dies or is detected, the original character is released from the magic rune prison, but must roll 2 times on this table and 1 time on the Last Seen in the Wilderness table.
18	角色跟随了一团鬼火，鬼火带领他们走出了地牢（如果可能，是通过与他们进来时不同的路径）。 The character followed a Will-o-the-Wisp which led them out of the dungeon (through a different way than the they came in, if available).
19	角色听到微弱的呻吟声，跟随声音找到了一名迷失的冒险者（1级战士），他是比玩家稍早或稍晚进入地城的队伍中唯一的幸存者。其余队员要么已死，要么逃离了地城，因此这位孤独的战士希望跟随玩家的角色。 The character heard a soft moaning and followed it to a lost adventurer (a level 1 Fighter), the sole survivor of a party that entered the dungeon shortly after or before the players. The rest of their group is either dead or has fled the dungeon, so the lone warrior wants to follow the player’s character.
20	同上，但这位失踪的冒险者实际上是个变形怪。 As above, except the lost adventurer actually is a Doppelgänger.
