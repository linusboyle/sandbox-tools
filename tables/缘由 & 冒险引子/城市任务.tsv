1d100	城市任务
1	集市日上，一个肮脏而困惑的男子在市场上奔跑，声称自己是真正的国王。他被城镇卫兵抓获，并下令在下个集市日公开处决。尽管如此，国王的一位顾问兼朋友雇佣了团队进行调查。 On a market day a dirty and confused man runs on the market place and claims to be the real king. He gets captured by the town's guard and it is ordered that he gets executed publicly the next market day. Despite that, an adviser and friend to the king hires the group to investigate.
2	有人企图暗杀队伍成员。他们在刺客尸体上发现了一张指示悬赏的纸条，以及一枚象征同一城市中某个强大家族的徽章。 There is an attempt on the party’s lives. They find a note on the assassins' body which indicates the hit placed, and an emblem which indicates a powerful house in the very same city.
3	队伍被一位本地商人雇佣，调查当地的赌场。最近，赌场吸引了大量顾客，但赌客们的运气却出奇地差。为何赌徒们无法赢钱？是什么吸引了如此多的人群？谁或什么需要如此大量的金币？ The party has been hired by a local merchant to investigate the local gambling hall. Lately, they've been pulling in lots more customers, and the luck of the patrons has been shockingly bad. Why can't the gamblers win? What has been drawing such large crowds? What or who would be in need of such a large amount of gold?
4	队伍回到他们下榻的旅店，却发现之前的所有住客和员工都消失了。只有人不见了，任何物品或私人物品都原封不动。 The party returns to the inn they are staying at, only to find all of its prior occupants and staff missing. Only the people are gone, any items or personal affects remain untouched.
5	一座以炫目杂技和惊人烟火闻名的著名马戏团来到城市，他们自夸不使用任何幻术，欢迎观众用魔法检测来验证；只有咒法系法术！实际上，马戏团是一个崇拜远方沙漠中太阳与火焰恶魔领主的邪教组织的幌子，通过绑架和献祭受害者，他们的巫师和杂技演员获得了力量。 A renowned circus has come to the city, known for their dazzling acrobatics and amazing pyrotechnics. They brag that no illusions are used, and onlookers are welcome to detect magic to verify that; evocations only! It turns out that the circus is a front for a cult to a demonic lord of the sun and fire worshipped in a far off desert, and by kidnapping and sacrificing victims, their wizards and acrobats gain their powers.
6	奇怪的是，镇上居民的左袜和左鞋不断消失。无论是从晾衣绳、鞋匠那里，还是从门廊前被偷走，都找不到它们的踪迹。 Mysteriously, townspeople's left socks and shoes have been disappearing. Stolen from the clothesline, from the cobbler, or from the front stoop, no sign of them have been found.
7	一位城市官员在权力位置上待了异常之久。他们看起来只是个普通人，然而城中无人对此感到丝毫奇怪。 A city official has held a position of power for an unnaturally long time. They appear to just be a normal human, yet no one in the city finds this the least bit odd.
8	城市博物馆正在举办一场古代怪物的超自然历史展览。一名死灵法师正在四处游荡。 The city museum is hosting a Para-natural History Exhibit of ancient monsters. A necromancer is on the loose.
9	一名当地渔民意外带回了一群红色史拉蟾蝌蚪，它们混入了为皇家宴会准备的渔获中。玩家必须争分夺秒找到并治愈被感染的贵族，以免他们从内部被吞噬并转化为史拉蟾。 A local fisherman accidentally brought back a red slaad tadpole cluster in his catch destined for a royal feast. Players must race against the clock to find and cure the infected nobles before they're eaten from the inside and turned into slaad.
10	附近的一群侏儒因洪水被迫离开家园。稍作调查发现，城市的水坝最近被改造，导致河流大部分改道，直接冲毁了他们的住所。 A nearby colony of gnomes have been uprooted due to a flood. A little investigation reveals the city's dam has been recently modified, which diverted a large portion of the river right through their home.
11	一位贵族最爱的面包店突然关门，毫无预兆。他对着曾经装满饼干的篮子哭泣，请求你找到那位面包师。 A nobleman's favorite bakery has shut down without warning. While weeping over a basket that once held cookies, he asks you to find the baker.
12	一位操着奇怪神秘语言的旅人支付了一大笔钱，请导游带他们游览这座城市。 A traveler speaking in a strange, mysterious language pays a large sum of money for a tour guide to show them the city.
13	有人四处散布不和的魔瓶。一场婚礼爆发了，死亡人数是平常的三倍！ Someone is spreading Discord Bottles everywhere. A wedding broke out, and 3x as many people as normal died!
14	一只巨大的恶魔在集市广场中央沉睡，所有镇民似乎都对其存在视而不见。 A large demon is asleep in the center of the market square. All the townsfolk are seemingly oblivious to its presence.
15	一位本地商人希望你能恐吓他们的竞争对手离开城镇。 A local merchant wants you to intimidate their competition out of town.

17	三座不同的教堂崇拜同一位神明，却在争论谁才是正统。 Three different churches worship the same god, but are arguing over who is right.
18	城中最大的药剂商被发现库存全是毒药，引发丑闻。数位冒险者在任务中身亡，但即便在诚实之域下，药剂师坚称对此毫不知情，声称库存必定被调换。 A scandal erupts when the largest potion-seller in town is discovered to have nothing but potions of poison stocked. Several adventurers have died on quests, but, even under a zone of truth, the potion maker says they have no knowledge of how this happened, claiming their stock must have been switched.
19	城市中正举行一场盛大的婚礼。队伍受雇阻止所有前任伴侣进入，其中包括一位来自异国的贵族。 There is a huge wedding in the city. The party is paid to stop all the ex partners from entering, and that includes a noble from a foreign land.
20	镇上新开了一家酒馆，生意异常火爆，售卖一种新型麦酒。酒馆老板独自经营，却无人见过麦酒的进货。而且看起来老板一个人也没有足够的空间酿造这么多麦酒。 There's a brand-new tavern in town, and it's extremely busy selling a new kind of ale. The Barkeep works alone and no one has seen any shipments of ale get delivered. It also doesn't look like there is very much room for the Barkeep to brew this much ale all by himself.
21	一位刚被封为骑士的年轻人，在镇上四处游走，向有需要的人提出接受任何挑战的提议。他资质严重不足，很快就开始陷入困境。 A young man who was recently knighted, goes around town offering to take on any challenge to those in need. He is woefully under qualified and quickly starts getting in over his head.
22	一位神秘神祇的祭司提出为队伍赐福，条件是帮助他们召集人群听布道。 The priest of an obscure God offers to bless the party if they help gather a crowd for a sermon.
23	城市的大学为学生举办了一场竞赛，在色彩爆发大战中最后站立的胜者将获得优先注册权。一位富有的学生雇佣了队伍，让他们伪装成学生协助其获胜，作为交换，他将教授队伍色彩爆发小法术并给予金钱奖励。 The city's university has offered a competition to it's students, last man standing in a Color Burst war wins priority registration. A rich student has hired the party to disguise themselves as students and help them win in exchange for teaching the party the Color Burst cantrip + gold reward.

26	一群披着斗篷的阴影人物持刀挟持了市长的儿子，随后消失在排水道中。 A group of hooded, shadowy figures takes the mayor's son at knifepoint and disappears into the sewers.
27	一位本地煽动者呼吁对邻国发动战争，其依据是队伍所知皆为谎言。公众似乎支持此举，但煽动者实则只为自身夺权。 A local firebrand calls for war against a neighboring nation, based on what the party knows to be lies. The public seems to be on board, but the firebrand is only trying to seize power for themselves.
28	一场柔和的雾气笼罩了城市，随着时间的推移逐渐变浓。次日清晨雾气散去时，大多数人都不记得发生了什么，而城里的所有银行金库都被洗劫一空。 A gentle fog descends upon the city, becoming slightly thicker over time. When it lifts the next morning, most people have no memory of what happened, and every bank vault in the city has been looted clean.
29	一些人醒来时额头上出现了一个符号。虽然有人投诉，但由于这些标记并未散发任何恶意魔法，被当作恶作剧而置之不理。但随后，城市广场上出现了被撕碎和折断的尸体，那些符号被刻在了上面。 Some people awake with a symbol on their foreheads. Complaints are made, but as the marks are not found to give off any malignant magic, it's brushed off as a prank. But then the bodies appear in the city square, mangled and broken, the symbols now carved in.
30	一位新商人途经城镇，售卖瓶装记忆等物品。一人饮下后，突然获得了奇异能力。 A new merchant traveling through town is selling bottled memories, among other items. One person, after drinking one, suddenly finds himself with a strange power.
31	来自四面八方的人们涌入城市，只为目睹雕塑花园中的“活雕像”。每天早晨花园重新开放时，所有雕像都摆出不同的姿势。 People from all around come to the city to see the “living statues” in the sculpture garden. Every morning when the gardens reopen all the statues are in a different pose.
32	一名女子为她的丈夫乞求帮助，声称他被错误地关押。 A woman begs for help on behalf of her husband, who she claims has been falsely imprisoned.
33	队伍无意中听到一个醉醺醺的半身人说，他们从叔叔的朋友那里听说，一场旨在推翻市长、为城市夺回自由的革命正在酝酿中。 The party overhears a drunk halfling who says they heard from a friend of their uncle's that there's a revolution forming to oust the mayor and bring freedom back to the city.
34	一位舞蹈与爱情女神降临城镇，其追随者与当地正统宗教发生冲突。可能有团体试图煽动双方暴力，以达到自己的目的。 A goddess of dancing and love arrives in town and her followers clash with the town's existing orthodox religion. A group may be trying to incite violence on both sides for their own aims.
35	城市被绑架了！某种实体或力量将城市从原址拔起，现漂浮在一片荒芜之地。队伍能否查明真相？他们能否将城市带回原处？在此期间，人们会作何反应？无疑，有些人会试图利用这新奇的境况…… The city has been kidnapped! Some entity or force has plucked the city out of its landscape. It now floats in a desolate landscape. Can the party find out what happened? And can they return the city to its home? What will the people do in the meantime? Some will no doubt seek to take advantage of this new, strange circumstance...
36	四兄弟各自在街角对面开设店铺，彼此竞争，愿意出金币以任何（非暴力）可能的方式打击其他店铺的销售。 Four brothers each have their own shop catty-corner to the others. They’re all competing with each other and offer gold to help hurt the sales of the other shops in any (non-violent) way possible.
37	在王国首都，一个实力相当的王国派遣了外交使团前来商讨结盟事宜。国王留下继承人，却带上了次子以示信任。在国王们商谈期间，队伍被指派去保护和陪伴这位只想喝酒、赌博和打架的王子。他想去的城区非常危险，而这位贵族又是个傲慢自夸的家伙，在打斗中勉强有点本事，足以惹上麻烦。队伍必须确保他出席宫廷舞会和仪式，同时还得保证他不自寻死路。 In the capital of a kingdom, a similarly powerful kingdom has sent a diplomatic envoy to discuss an alliance. The king has left his heir behind, but brought his second son as a sign of trust. While the kings discuss, the party is assigned to protect and entertain the prince, who only wants to drink, gamble, and fight. The parts of town he wants to go to are very dangerous and the noble is an arrogant braggart, just skilled enough in a fight to get into trouble. The party has to ensure he's at the palace for the required balls and ceremonies, while also making sure he doesn't get himself killed.
38	图书馆因忙于处理鼠患且人手严重不足，拒绝提供相关信息。他们同意帮助，前提是玩家能说服国王增加他们的收入并解决鼠患问题。 A library refuses to provide pertinent information because they are too busy dealing with a rat infestation, as well as being abysmally under-staffed. They’ll agree to help if the players can convince the king to increase their income and their infestation is taken care of.
39	一位王子渴望了解世界的真实面貌，使用伪装工具试图融入其中。队伍将担任他的护卫。 A prince wishes to see what the world is really like and using a disguise kit they aim to blend in. The party will serve as protection.
40	当地领主在近期战争耗尽了卫兵后，雇佣了一支佣兵团维持治安。佣兵们已掌控城镇，截留所有税收，还向领主索要报酬。领主请求暗中援助，希望避免街头爆发战斗。 The local lord hired a mercenary band to keep the peace after a recent war depleted his guards. The mercs have taken over the town and are keeping all taxes and still demanding payment from the lord. the lord requests subtle aid, wishing to avoid a battle in the streets.
41	城市注意到失踪案件急剧增加，全部集中在当地公园（或附近森林）。调查后，队伍发现这些植物是食肉性的！更糟的是，一位高阶妖精视这些植物为心爱的宠物。队伍会选择用言语还是刀剑来谈判？ The city has noticed a sharp increase in missing persons cases all centered around the local Park (or nearby forest). Upon investigation, the party discovers the plants are carnivores! What’s worse, an arch fey considers these plants his/her beloved pets. Will the party negotiate with words or steel?
42	一年一度的节日可能被取消，因为所有歌手都神秘地失去了嗓音。 An annual festival might get canceled, because all the singers are mysteriously losing their voices.
43	队伍被指控犯下多起谋杀，目击者声称亲眼所见。他们必须谨慎调查，以查明真相。 The party is accused of several murders, by witnesses saying they saw them do it. The party has to be tactful in investigating the murders so they can find out what happened.
44	一位吟游诗人学院的院长正在寻找新曲目，以在即将到来的皇家盛事上演奏。他提到，这座城市的一位前统治者下葬时陪葬了一首为他谱写的乐曲，但从未有人听过。他愿意支付一笔可观的黄金，因为从皇家地下墓穴的棺椁中取物是极其违法的。 The head of a Bard's college is looking for something new to play at an upcoming royal event. They mention that one of the previous rulers of the city was buried with music written in his honor, but it's never been heard. He would pay a fair amount of gold, as retrieving something from inside a casket of the royal catacomb is highly illegal.
45	一个崇拜死灵之神的邪教一直秘密存在，无人察觉！当队伍得知此事时，黑暗仪式已经完成，死者开始从坟墓中爬出。在队伍击退尸体并击败邪教后，他们面临一个重要问题……为什么市长的后院会冒出十几具僵尸？ A cult of a necromantic death god has existed in secrecy and no one found out! By the time the party learns of it, the dark ritual is already over and the dead begin rising from their graves. After the party fights off the corpses and defeats the cult, they are left with an important question... Why did over a dozen zombies rise up from the mayor's backyard?
46	城中一处区域突发火灾，火势尚可控制，未蔓延太广。这并非意外，趁人们忙于救火之际，有人闯入并清空了城市金库，导致城市守卫关闭了所有城门。看来作案者必有内应。 A fire breaks out in a part of town where it’s not too hard to put it out before it spreads too much. It’s no accident and while people were busy with the fire someone broke into and emptied the City Treasury, so the City Watch closed all the gates. It seems whoever did it had a person on the inside.
47	国王唯一的继承人突然去世，关于一个私生子的谣言迅速传播。多个派系为了各自的目的正竞相追捕他。 The King's only heir has died suddenly, and rumors are quickly spreading of an illegitimate son. Several factions are racing to hunt him down for their own purposes.
48	一个变形怪潜入了城市，它假扮成孩子的父母，将孩子们诱骗到附近的森林中。随着越来越多的父母看到自己的伴侣带着孩子进入森林，而伴侣却毫无记忆并对指控感到愤怒，不安情绪在城市中蔓延。 A doppelganger has infiltrated the city. It pretends to be children's parents and lures them away into the nearby forest. Unrest grows as the last thing a parent usually sees is their partner taking their child into the forest, but the partner has no recollection and resents the accusations.
49	一位商人指责居住在下水道的一群哥布林偷走了家族遗物。经过调查，英雄们找到了哥布林。他们辩解称只是想保护城市免受即将到来的威胁。 A merchant accuses a group of goblins that live in the sewers of stealing a family relic. Upon investigation, the heroes find the goblins. They excuse themselves that they only wanted to protect the city from what's to come.
50	深夜，古老的金币被悄悄放在各家门口。无人目睹是谁所为。许多市民心生疑虑，尤其是那些未收到礼物的人，传言四起，称那些捡了别人门口金币的人遭遇了厄运。 Ancient gold coins are being left on doorsteps at night. No one has seen anybody doing it. Many of the townsfolk are suspicious, especially those that have not been given a gift, and tales are spreading about the ill fortune that has befallen those that have taken gold left on someone else's doorstep.
51	城市的黑市最近显著衰退。国王亲自委托队伍恢复其繁荣。 The city's black market has recently regressed, quite significantly. The King himself has tasked the party with restoring it.
52	城市郊区的一座建筑在隧道中倒塌，人们将责任归咎于附近的矮人矿井，因为越来越多的建筑开始坍塌。尽管地方当局乐于指责矮人，但有人找到英雄们，坚称这些绝非矿井洞穴。 A building on the outskirts of the city collapses in a tunnel. People blame the nearby dwarven mines as more and more buildings collapse. While the local authority is happy to blame the dwarfs, someone approaches the heroes and asserts that these are certainly no mine caves.
53	一位屠夫发现他的肉比往常提前几天腐烂，怀疑有竞争对手使用巫术想把他挤出市场。 A butcher has noticed his meat is rotting days earlier than usual and he suspects a competitor is using sorcery to push him out of business.
54	一位著名巫师住在镇上，善良但健忘。巫师宣布前往元素位面，希望找到黄金或宝石以帮助镇子摆脱贫困（或其他客观良善的目标）。巫师离开期间，盗贼公会闯入巫师住所，意外激活了巫师的傀儡，导致它们失控狂暴。 A famed wizard lives in town, kind but absent-minded. The wizard makes an announced trip to the Elemental Planes, hoping to find gold or gems to help the town end poverty (or some other objectively good goal). While they are gone, the thieves' guild breaks into the wizard's town, activating triggering the wizard's golems who go berserk.
55	领主的子女被绑架，雇佣调查的私家侦探失联。其秘书已发布悬赏，寻找冒险者前往他最后已知的地点——教堂地下室进行调查…… The lord's child has been kidnapped and the PI hired to investigate hasn't checked in. His secretary has posted a bounty looking for adventures to investigate his last known location, the chapel undercroft...
56	有人正在全城破坏水井，并将水染成红色。然而，有一口井中似乎真的有血液。这是否是为了掩盖某种恶行而进行的误导？ Someone is sabotaging wells throughout the city and dying the water red. But, one well seems to actually have blood in it. Misdirection to cover up a heinous act?
57	格鲁布·格鲁布终于攒够了资金，准备开设他的送餐服务：格瑞布·格布枢纽。然而，他需要送餐员！如果你能成功在城市中送达三份餐点，他将慷慨地奖励你。 Grub Grub the orc has finally accrued enough capital to open his meal delivery service: Grib Gub Hub. However, he needs delivery people! If you deliver 3 meals across the city, he will reward you handsomely.
58	卫兵们因薪资与工作权利纠纷，正密谋推翻当地领主。领主则计划带领少数骑士突袭工匠，认为他们偷窃市民财物。工匠们则因卫兵滥用职权，意图驱逐他们。玩家将站在哪一边？ The watchmen are planning a coup against the local lord, over a wage and working rights dispute. The lord is planning to raid the craftsman with his few knights, believing them to be stealing from the citizenry. The craftsmen plan to oust the watchmen, sick of them abusing their authority. Which side will the players take?

64	PC们被雇佣为一群保姆。然而，就在他们认为这是一项轻松任务时，他们发现这些并非普通婴儿。 The PCs are hired as a group of babysitters. However, just when they think it is an easy task, they realize these are no ordinary babies.
65	城中各处突然出现多张通缉令，悬赏金额极为丰厚。通缉对象的名字无人知晓，但画像与某位玩家角色如出一辙。 Multiple copies of a wanted poster sprout up over town. The bounty reward is a hefty sum. The wanted individual has an unrecognizable name, but the drawn portrait is the spitting image of a PC.
66	国王委托队伍清除城堡大池塘中的致命鳗鱼。他的前任曾用这些鳗鱼喂养叛徒、哗变者和高级罪犯。新国王认为它们令人不快，但无法在不破坏池塘的情况下安全移除它们。 The King commissions the party to clear his castle's large pond of the deadly eels within. His predecessor had them placed to feed traitor's, mutineers, and high-class criminals too. The new King thinks they're distasteful, but has no apparent way to safely remove them while keeping the pond [mostly] intact.
67	一名为武器商采购镀银匕首的商人在城镇阴暗角落的巷子里被发现遭刺身亡，其库存中的镀银匕首被盗。线索指向一群藏身于废弃房屋的鼠人帮派。 A merchant that was procuring silvered daggers for a weapons dealer was found stabbed in an alleyway in a shady part of town, and the silvered daggers were stolen from his inventory.

A local scholar is attempting to learn necromancy to bring back their SO. The mayor has desperately posted a large bounty, as his guards have proven incapable of finding the graverobber.

94	几只觉醒的老鼠对队伍的成就印象深刻，并寻求他们的帮助。它们想潜入一家杂货店偷食物，以及当天早些时候刚送到的一些大奶酪轮。它们会用在下水道找到的几枚硬币作为报酬，并欠队伍一个人情。帮助后，它们表示只要队伍在城镇时在某个下水道格栅外留下一些发霉的奶酪并等待它们找到，它们就会前来援助。 Several awakened rats are impressed with the parties' accomplishments, and seek their assistance. They want help sneaking into a general goods store to steal food, and a few large cheese wheels that just got delivered earlier that day. They will reward the party with a few coins they found in the sewer, and owe the party a favor. After helping, they state they will come to the party's aid while in town, if they but leave some moldy cheese outside a sewer grate and wait for them to find it.
95	城市各处老人神秘失踪，留下关于“超越此世”的隐晦笔记。 Old people keep mysteriously disappearing all over the city, leaving behind cyptic notes about 'moving past this world'.
96	一名连环杀手潜伏在城市中，每次行凶后都会留下一张关于下一个目标的谜语纸条。队伍受雇在杀手再次作案前将其捉拿归案。 A serial killer is lurking in the city. Each time when they kill, they leave a note with a riddle about who is their next target. The party is hired to capture the killer before they strike again.
97	本地盗贼公会请求帮助，因其多名成员接连身亡。 Local Thieves Guild requests help as several of their members have turned up dead.
98	一群顽皮的精怪占据了镇上最受欢迎的酒馆作为他们的私人俱乐部，他们拒绝离开，并用恶作剧和扭曲的把戏赶走任何试图驱逐他们的人。 A mischievous group of fey have taken the town's favoured tavern as their personal clubhouse, they refuse to leave and use pranks and twisted tricks to turn back anybody that attempts to evict them.
99	一位年轻女战士愿意支付报酬、接受雇佣或参与竞赛以猎杀怪物并运走大量肉块。如果玩家在她之前完成任务，她会急切地提出购买这些肉。她为何需要如此大量的新鲜肉类，包括怪物肉？ A young warrior girl will pay, be paid, or compete to slay monsters and hauls away the large amounts of meat. If the players complete a task before she does, she’ll offer to buy the meat (kind of urgently.) What could she be doing with huge amounts of fresh meat, monster and otherwise?
100	一位当地巫师二十多年前去世，留下他的塔楼被锁住并设下防护。唯一知道如何进入的学徒却闭口不谈。当询问他人所知时，他们迅速转移话题。那些在阴影中潜伏的人可能会低声议论，听起来塔楼中藏着比书籍和药瓶更为黑暗的东西。 A local wizard passed away over 20 years ago, leaving his tower locked and warded. The only one with any clue as to how to get in, his apprentice, isn't talking. When others are asked about what they know, they quickly divert the conversation. Those that slink in the shadows may whisper about it, and it sounds like the tower holds things much darker than just books and phials.
