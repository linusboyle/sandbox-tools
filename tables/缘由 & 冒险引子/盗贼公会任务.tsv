1d100	盗贼公会任务
1	潜入男爵夫人的船上，偷走她的护身符。她从不离身，甚至在睡觉时也戴着它，所以发挥你的想象力吧！（无人知晓：这护身符被诅咒了。一旦触碰，就必须佩戴。佩戴者无法丢弃它，也无法请求他人取下。护身符要求你每天吸取他人的寿命，使这些人迅速衰老，你必须服从。作为小奖励，它能让你永葆青春。） Sneak on board the baroness’ ship and steal her amulet. She never departs from this amulet and even wears it in her sleep, so be imaginative! (No one knows: the amulet is cursed. Once touched, one must wear it. It cannot be dropped by the one who wears it and one is not able to ask someone else to take it away. The amulet requires you to drain the lifetime out of people every day, which ages these people fast and you must obey. As a small bonus, it keeps you forever young.)
2	我们的一位成员，吉迪恩·丹斯，即将结婚并打算走上正道（差不多）。他的新娘是一位有权势商人的独生女，两人是天作之合。但有一个问题——当地卫队队长曾是新娘的追求者，因被拒绝而心怀怨恨，正收集证据准备在婚礼当天逮捕吉迪恩。我们需要你潜入卫队队长的房间，偷走证据，并用明显伪造的证据替换。 One of our members, Gideon Dance, is getting married and going straight(ish). His bride is the only daughter of a powerful merchant, and the two will make a great pair. There's only one problem- the local captain of the guard is a spurned admirer of Gideon's wife-to-be, and is assembling evidence to arrest Gideon on the day of the wedding. We need you to steal the evidence from the Captain's Chambers in the guardhouse and replace it with evidence that's clearly fraudulent.
3	一位年轻贵族需要你潜入敌对家族的宅邸，取回他们与其中一位居民在禁忌激情之夜后遗落的衣物。 A young noble needs you to break into the mansion of a rival family and retrieve an item of clothing they left behind after a forbidden night of passion with one of the inhabitants.
4	紧急任务！我们在自家掩护业务中误杀了几人，但我们的探子听到附近有巡逻卫兵，惊慌逃离。卫兵并未进入建筑，因此还有挽回余地。潜入其中，消除所有暴力痕迹，带走尸体，藏到远处。此事必须今晚完成，因为建筑明日需照常营业。 Urgent mission! We killed some people in a front business of ours, but when our agents heard a guard patrol nearby, they got spooked and fled. The guards didn't actually enter the building, so there's still a way to make this right. Sneak in, erase any trace of violence, take the corpses, and hide them somewhere far away. This must be done tonight, since the building has to open for business as usual tomorrow.
5	一位自由窃贼趁艾谢夫人外出时，从她家中偷走了一些珠宝。他的第一个错误是选择独立而非加入我们。第二个错误是偷了向我们支付保护费的人。我们知道窃贼藏身的大致区域——追踪他，找到珠宝，将其与这封道歉信一同包装，归还给夫人。这位自由窃贼要么加入公会，要么死路一条。 A freelance thief stole some jewelry from Lady Aisheh's home while she was out of town. His first mistake was being independent instead of joining us. His second mistake was stealing from someone who pays us protection money. We know the general area where the thief is hiding - track him down, find the jewelry, put it in a package with this apology letter, and return it to the Lady. The freelancer himself must either join the guild or die.
6	我要你找到阿格温·诺斯达并跟踪她。花几天时间了解她，别让她察觉你在收集情报。一旦你认为掌握了重要证据，回来向我汇报，我们看看你做得如何。 I want you to find Agwen Northstar for me and tail her. Spend a few days doing this and get to know her without her realizing you’re getting information. Once you think you’ve gathered significant evidence, report your findings back to me and we’ll see how well you did.
7	你的任务是偷走一辆满载魔法药水的完整马车。这辆马车已在前往王国的路上。由13辆马车组成的车队，包括我们的目标马车，昨日从遥远城市雷霆港启程，此前他们乘船抵达该地。车队的牛马被魔法强化，能以疯狂的速度连续奔跑7天不停歇。两位高阶巫师将确保魔法持续生效，每辆马车上都有守卫。货物被锁在大型金属笼中运输。你只能在雷霆港与王国之间的山脉中拦截车队。一旦他们穿过山脉，进入开阔的平原，你就再无机会。车队将穿越一处重兵把守的山谷，那里有3名德鲁伊驱散云层，因为一旦下雨，山谷便无法通行。这是你的机会！ Your task is to steal a complete wagon full of magical potions. The wagon is already on its way to the kingdom. A convoy of 13 carts, including our cart, started yesterday from the remote city of Thunderhaven after arriving there by ship. The oxen and horses of the convoy are magically enhanced to run the whole 7 days at insane speed without any stop. Two high wizards will ensure that the magic persists and there will be guards on the carts. The goods are transported in large locked metal cages. You can only intercept the convoy in the mountains between Thunderhaven and the Kingdom. Once it passed the mountains they were out in the open plains and out of reach for you. At one point the convoy rushes through a heavily guarded canyon in the mountains where 3 druids keep the clouds away, because the canyon is impassable if it rains. This is your chance!
8	矮人贵族基拉克兹·石切者之所以能登上现位，全因盗贼公会从其祖墓中窃取了古代矮人贵族的徽章。不幸的是，我们的小基拉克兹开始妄自尊大，颁布法令影响我们的职责。潜入他戒备森严的庄园，夺回那枚徽章，尽量不留入侵痕迹。让他心生疑惧，正好提醒他我们的手段与过往交易。 The Dwarven Noble, Kirakzz Stonehewer, only arrived at his current position thanks to the Thieves' Guild stealing the Crest of an Ancient Dwarven Noble from their ancestral tomb. Unfortunately, our little Kirakzz has been getting ideas above his station and passing edicts that have been affecting our duties. Sneak into his fortified manor and steal that crest back, leaving as little evidence of your intrusion as possible. A little paranoia should serve as a reminder of our skills and past dealings.
9	公会中的一位大盗已逝。向他们表示敬意，或许能让上级对你印象深刻，从而获得晋升。通过偷取一件极其珍贵的物品并将其永久丢弃、焚烧或投入海中以示尊重。 A great thrift of the guild has died. Show respect to them and you might impress the bosses enough for a promotion. Show respect by stealing something really valuable and throw it away for good, burn it or drop it in the ocean.
10	一种新药在城市的街头悄然出现。盗贼公会想要查明制造者是谁、制造地点在哪里，以及如何掌控这两点及其市场。 A new drug has been showing up on the streets of the city. The guild wants to know who is making it, where they are making it and how they can control those 2 things as well as the market for it.
11	我们的客户要你偷走一台真正能飞的机器原型！潜入侏儒工匠辛卡特·银比特的工厂，偷走这台机器。完成后将其交给客户，领取你的报酬。 Our client wants you to steal the prototype of a machine that is actually able to fly! Sneak into the factory of artificer gnome Zinkkart Silverbit and steal the machine. After that, deliver it to the client and get your reward.
12	我们的客户愿意支付巨额金币，只要你能从罗顿勋爵那里偷取一些宝藏。只需闯入他的庄园……偷走他关于荒芜之地某座金矿的所有记忆。之后他将对此一无所知，而客户需要这些记忆来定位金矿并找到进入的方法。 Our client is willing to pay an insane amount of gold if you can steal some treasure from Lord Ronton. Simply break into his estate and ... steal all the memories he has about a certain gold mine in the barren lands. He shall not remember any of it afterwards and the client needs the memories to locate the mine and how to access it.
13	皇家炼金师研制出了一种效力极强的真言药剂，严重威胁到盗贼公会的存续。此药剂不仅强迫服用者说出真相，还迫使其尽可能配合提问者。更糟的是，似乎任何魔法或心智训练都无法抵抗其效果。皇家卫队迟早会抓获公会成员并对其使用药剂，从而揭露整个行动。你需要潜入炼金师的住所，找到药剂配方以便研制解药。若无法做到，则需杀死或绑架炼金师。哦，顺便尽可能多带走这种真言药剂——别让它白白浪费了。 The royal alchemist has developed a truth potion so potent it threatens the very existence of the guild. This potion not only forces someone to tell the truth, but it compels them to be as helpful as possible to the questioner. What's worse, it seems that no amount of magic or mental training can resist it. It's only a matter of time before the Royal Guard captures a guild member and uses it on them, revealing the whole operation. We need you to break into the alchemist's apartments and find the formula for the potion so a counter agent can be developed. Failing that, either kill or kidnap the alchemist. Oh, and grab as much of this truth potion as you can find - no use letting it go to waste.
14	我们盯上的一幅画最近从城市博物馆转移到了一个私人收藏中。只有博物馆馆长知道是谁买下了它。但馆长人脉太广，威胁或绑架都不行，我们也没多余的钱贿赂她，找不到她的把柄，而且我们的勒索伪造师病倒了。所以你得——天哪！——真的说服她透露画的下落。或者骗她？我们给你弄到了她将参加的派对的门票，祝你好运。你可以告诉她你们是贼，但别让她知道你们是公会的人。 A painting we're after recently got transferred out of the city museum to a private collection. Only the museum curator knows who bought it. But the curator's too connected to threaten or kidnap, we don't have the spare funds to bribe her, we couldn't find any dirt on her and our blackmail forger's out sick. So you're gonna have to - gasp! - actually convince her to give the painting's location. Or trick her, I guess? We got you tickets for a party she's going to, good luck. You can tell her you're thieves but don't let her know you're with the guild.
15	国王拥有一枚魔法戒指，能让他感知朝臣是否在说谎。某位公会首领想要据为己有，或至少不让国王继续持有。他们为获取此物提供了丰厚奖赏。（已附魔的戒指允许施放诚实之域）转折点：这是一枚脚趾戒指。 The king has a magic ring which permits him to perceive whether his courtiers are lying to him. One of the guild masters wants it for himself, or at least doesn't want the King to have it anymore. They are offering a sizable prize for its acquisition. (Attuned ring permits the casting of Zone of Truth) Twist: it's a toe ring.
16	昨日，我们最尊贵的成员之一，酒鬼亨利因罪行被处以绞刑。从监狱停尸房偷走他的尸体，并交给公会的死灵法师。亨利还需要在这里多工作几年，我们才能让他退休。 Yesterday, Henry the Drinker, one of our most honorable members, was hanged for his crimes. Steal his corpse from the prison morgue and deliver it to the guild's necromant. Henry needs to work a few more years here before we can let him retire.
17	我们的尊贵同僚“双匕”目前被囚禁，他掌握着我们不希望皇家卫队得到的重要信息。我们需要你协助我们解救他。若无法实现，则需让他永远沉默。 Two Daggers, one of our esteemed colleagues, is currently imprisoned. He has sensible information that we wouldn't want the royal guards to get a hold of. We need you to help us free him. And if this is not possible, to silence him.
18	一个敌对盗贼公会以一只鹅作为其吉祥物，作为宠儿养在总部。任务是将这只鹅（活着）带回来，且在执行任务时不能被看见或听见——我们要让公会成员在早上醒来时震惊地发现他们心爱的鹅不见了。此外，为避免公会战争，在此任务中不得杀害敌对盗贼公会的任何成员。（这只是一只普通的鹅，意味着它吵闹且烦人。）笑点在于，每个公会都用这个任务来考验新成员，而“敌对”成员并不会真正努力阻止任务成功。最后，双方公会的代表会聚在一起，在一场盛大的宴会上欢迎新成员，主菜是……烤鹅。 A rival thieves' guild has a goose as its mascot, kept as a pampered pet in its headquarters. The goose has to be brought back (alive) and you can't be seen or heard during the mission -- we want the guild members to wake up in the morning and be shocked their beloved goose is gone. Also, to avoid a guild war, you can't kill any members of the rival thieves' guild during this mission. (It's just an ordinary goose, which means it's loud and obnoxious.) The punchline is each guild uses this mission to break in new members, and the 'rival' members won't try very hard to stop the mission from succeeding. At the end, representatives from each guild join together to welcome the new member at an elaborate feast, the main course being... roast goose.
19	昨夜，沉船“伍德鲁夫”被冲上了岸。这艘船对于寻找快速致富的打捞者来说是一座金矿，但关于幽灵船员的传闻吓退了许多人。尽管那些失踪船员灵魂的潜在威胁令一些人担忧，但终究是需要克服的障碍。你的任务是彻底调查这艘船，并将找到的任何宝藏带给我。如果遇到其他打捞者，只有在他们先攻击你的情况下，才可使用致命武力。 The sunken ship, Woodruff, washed up on shore last night. This ship, while a gold mine for salvagers looking to make some quick gold, rumors of a ghostly crew have driven many away. While the potential for the spirits of the long lost crew are a concern to some, it is ultimately an obstacle to overcome. Your job is to investigate the ship thoroughly and bring any treasure you find to me. If you encounter any other salvagers, you may use lethal force only if they attack you first.
20	公会中一位显赫成员正在对一位富有的目标实施骗局，队伍被雇佣参与其中扮演角色。 A prominent member of the guild is running a con on a wealthy mark and the party has been hired to play a part.
21	你的公会遭遇了城中不受欢迎的走私竞争。你的任务是洗劫他们的行动基地并在黎明前撤离。每位成员奖励100金币。若不留活口并将所有值钱物品带回公会，每位成员额外奖励50金币。 Your guild has encountered some unwanted smuggling competition in the city. Your job is to ransack their base of operations and leave before dawn. Reward is 100GP per member. Bonus 50 gold per member if they leave no survivors and take everything of value back to the guild.
22	我们的一个客户需要你悄悄替换一份文件，用我们提供的那份。这是一份遗嘱。没错，有人想在自己的继承权上占更大便宜。我们需要你潜入一座豪宅，把它放进锁着的保险箱里，且不被任何人察觉。一旦被发现，整个计划将彻底泡汤。家庭律师将在几天内到达审查，所以这件事必须立即完成，很可能要在今晚之前。小心点，豪宅因庄园主人的去世而戒备森严。 One of our clients needs you to discreetly switch out a document with one we provide you. It is a last will and testament. Yes, someone is wanting a better stake in their inheritance. We need you to break into a mansion and place it inside the locked safe without anyone noticing. It will completely jeopardize the plan if you get detected. The family lawyer will be arriving within the next few days to review it so this must be done immediately, probably by the end of the night. Be careful, the mansion should be armed to the teeth with the death of the estate owner.
23	（从中层头目守卫森严的办公室窃取账簿。）“我们怀疑一位经理未将全额分成上缴。潜入其办公室，找到真实的账本。小心行事，因高层间争斗，经理办公室目前守卫众多。或许能贿赂那个叫鲍比·亮眼的家伙提前离岗——他觊觎经理之位已久——但若你被抓，他不会相助。建议趁经理去女友家时行动，他会带走部分守卫，办公室人手会减少。” (Heist accounting books from the mid boss's guarded office.) 'We think one of our managers is not giving the uppers their full cut. Go around to the manager's office and find his real books. And watch yourself, because of the war going on between some of the upper offices, the manager's place is well staffed with enforcers at the moment. You might be able to bribe the one called Bobby Brighteyes into leaving his shift early - he's had his eye on the manager's job for a while - but he isn't going to help you if you get caught. We recommend you go when the manager is at his girlfriend's place. He takes some enforcers with him as guards, so staff at the office gets thinner.'
24	“刀客麦克”的巡回表演团来到镇上！不幸的是，你的公会都知道，麦克走到哪，“寄生虫米妮”必定随行，而她的个人挑战就是偷窃其他盗贼…… Mack the Knife's Travelling Performance troupe has come to town! Unfortunately, your guild all knows that wherever Mack goes, Minnie the Moocher is sure to be with him, and her personal challenge is thieving from other thieves...
25	当地一位公爵据说明天将穿越一片密林，他随身携带着各种珍宝。（玩家们不知道的是，公爵和他的随从进入森林时已被抢劫。现在所谓的“公爵和他的护卫”其实是一个敌对盗贼公会的成员假扮的，以免引起怀疑。真正的公爵目前被绑在一个由马匹驮着的箱子里。） The Duke of a local region is supposedly traveling through a dense forest tomorrow. He is known to travel with all kinds of riches. (What the players don't know is, the Duke had already been robbed when he and his men entered the forest. The 'Duke and his guards' are members of a rival Thieves Guild pretending to be them so they don't rouse suspicion. The real Duke is currently tied up in a chest that a horse is carrying behind them.)
26	这是杀害公主的凶器！确保它落入某位贵族的口袋，以嫁祸于他。 This is the murder weapon that killed the princess! See that it finds its way into the pockets of a certain nobleman to frame him with the murder.
27	从某人处偷取X，但必须用复制品替换X（可能带有魔法追踪装置）。 Steal X from someone BUT you must replace X for a copy (perhaps with a magical tracking device).
28	凯恩山矮人发现了一种新材料。遗憾的是，我们与凯恩家族的外交关系……并不理想。我们需要尽可能多地获取这种新材料的信息。潜入山中，为我们获取情报。 A new material has been found by the dwarves of Khairn's mountain. Sadly, our diplomatic relation to Khairn's family is ... not the best. We need all the information we can get on this new material. Sneak into the mountain and get us the information.
29	穿上[敌对/替罪羊团体]的制服去犯罪。确保被目击但未被抓获，让他们不会意识到你们是冒牌货。并且要让犯罪看起来逼真。 Put on these uniforms of [enemy/scapegoat group] and go commit a crime. Get witnessed, but not caught, so they don't realize you're imposters. And make it look realistic.
30	盗贼公会成员接连被杀，尸体被遗弃在街头。队伍受雇调查这些谋杀案，最终追踪到了一位蒙面义警的踪迹。 Thieves' Guild members are being murdered and their bodies being left in the streets. The party is hired to investigate these murders, and finds themselves on the trail of a masked vigilante.
31	你只需从“利维坦”号船长的房间里偷走一个带有皇家徽章的小金箱。唯一的问题是，这艘船两年前在公海沉没，有传言说船员们仍在守护着它。不过别担心！我们相信这里有正确的坐标。 You simply need to steal a small golden chest with the royal emblem from the captain's room of the ship 'Leviathan'. The only problem is that the ship sank two years ago out on the open sea and rumors are that the crew still protects the ship. But do not worry! We think we have the correct coordinates here.
32	我们在[邻近城市]的一位同伙正被法律高度通缉。他正在城郊低调藏身，但该城周边的道路被国王卫队严密巡逻。你需要将他安全带到这座城市，无论是通过旅途中藏匿他，还是击退遇到的每一支巡逻队。 An associate of ours in [neighboring city] is highly wanted by the law. He's laying low on the outskirts, but the roads around that city are heavily patrolled by the king's guard. You need to get him to this city safely, either by hiding him while traveling, or fighting off every guard patrol you encounter.
33	这是个轻松活儿。去贵族家偷东西，想拿什么拿什么，别杀人。目标是个混蛋，镇上没人喜欢他。而且他还是队伍中某位角色的叔叔。如果队伍拒绝任务，下一个接手的盗贼可能不会对使用暴力有所顾忌。 It's an easy job. Rob the nobleman's house, take what you want, don't kill anyone. The target is a jerk that nobody in town likes anyway. The target is also the uncle of one of the characters in the party. If the party turns down the job, the next thief to take the job may not have any qualms about using violence.
34	在广场周围布置5个装置，当新大祭司的雕像在本周末揭幕时，这些装置会向雕像喷射不同颜色的油漆。作为回报，让他在关于社会败类的演讲中提及公会。 Prepare 5 contraptions around the great plaza that will shoot paint in different colors onto the statue of the new high priest when it will be revealed at the end of the week. A small gift in return for mentioning the guild in one of his speeches about the scum of the society.
35	一位富商今早将乘船入港，船上携有一只普通的小黑木箱，镶有少许金线和银质金属配件。箱内藏有文件，可能改变未来几年城市的政治格局。你被给予一个完全相同但仅装有无用卷轴的箱子，任务是调换箱子并将商人的箱子交给公会。然而你不知的是：另一组人也有相同计划，且今日港口还有一位矮人女士使用相同的箱子，但仅用于存放她的内衣。祝你好运玩转这场骗局！ A rich merchant will enter the port this morning with his ship. On board he has an ordinary small chest of black wood with a bit of golden inlay and silver metal fittings. Inside are some documents that may change the city politics for the upcoming years. Now, you were given an exact copy of that chest containing only some useless scrolls and your task is to exchange the chests and deliver the chest of the merchant to the guild. What you do not know is this: Another group has the same plan and there is also a dwarven lady at that port today that uses the same chest, but only for her underclothes. Happy Shell Game!
36	一名初级盗贼过于野心勃勃，成功从当地一位中立且略有些疯狂的死灵法师那里偷走了一件关键物品。这可不是好消息。潜入死灵法师的塔楼，将其归还，并确保不留下任何被取走的痕迹。 A junior burglar got too ambitious and succeeded in nabbing a macguffin from a local unaligned and slightly unhinged necromancer. Which is bad news. Break into the necromancer's tower and return it, and leave no trace that anything was ever taken.
37	欧文“糖果人”霍恩布拉特因王国每年参与的彩票而将获得一笔可观的财富。欧文，一个腐败的小混混，从合法拥有者——一个善良的销赃者那里勒索了彩票凭证，而盗贼公会经常与这位销赃者做生意。今年奖池的奖金为10,000金币。通常公会会让霍恩布拉特立即丧命，但由于他绑架了销赃者的孩子，公会必须确保孩子安全归来，这意味着要跟随欧文回到他在首都的安全屋。（孩子被欧文帮派的成员绑架，并被带到首都的一个藏身处。）欧文坚称，在完成彩票凭证兑换后，他会安全归还孩子。有传言称，如果欧文死了，安全屋的帮派成员将奉命杀死孩子。幸运的是，糖果人需要雇佣保镖来保护他的彩票凭证，他将带着凭证前往首都兑现。据说他已经雇佣了6个人来确保他前往首都的安全，但凭借公会“提供”的正确文件，你的队伍可能可以作为额外的保镖陪同他。目标：渗透糖果人的团队，确保欧文一分钱也拿不到，并陪同他前往首都，救出目前位于首都但位置未知的孩子。那张彩票凭证是公会代表黑暗母亲的合法财产。完成此事。 Irving “Candy Man” Hornblatt is to come into a fair amount of wealth due to a lottery which the kingdom participates in annually. Irving, a corrupt small-time gangster, extorted the voucher from its rightful owner, a kind fence with whom the guild frequents business with. The winnings in this year’s pot: 10,000 gp. Usually the guild would see that Hornblath die immediately, but seeing as he has kidnapped The Fence’s child, the guild must ensure the child’s safe return, which means following Irving back to his safe house in the capital. (The child was abducted by members of Irving’s gang, who delivered the child to a hide out in the capital.) Irving has insisted that upon completion of exchanging the voucher he will return the child safely. Word is, if Irving dies, the gang at the safe house has orders to kill the child. Fortunately for the guild, the Candy Man is in need of hired muscle to protect his proof of Lottery winning, the voucher which he will be taking the capital to cash. Word is he’s already hired 6 men to keep him safe on his Journey to the capital, but with the right paperwork “provided” by the guild, your party may be able to accompany him as additional hired muscle. The goal: infiltrate the candyman’s team, see to it that Irving Never sees a coin of lottery gold, and accompany him to the capital and save the child, whose location is currently in the Capital and unknown. That voucher is rightful property of the guild, on behalf of the dark mother. Finish this.
38	公会内一个新崛起的派系正试图推翻公会领袖。他们已煽动不满数月，如今正是对那老家伙下手之时。他们希望你在时机到来时协助刺杀领袖及其副手。你是加入他们，还是告发他们？亦或保持中立，试图将局势转为己用…… An upstart faction in the guild is trying to depose the guild leader. They've fermented dissent for months, and now is the time to strike at the old so-and-so. They want your help killing the leader and the guild lieutenants when the moment arrives. Do you join them or inform them? Or perhaps you could stay neutral and try to turn the situation to your own advantage...
39	皇家总管雇佣了维尔特爵士杜加什担任捕贼官。杜加什爵士正在赶来，五天后到达。在他到来之前，你需要伪造并植入证据，构陷市长和市议会参与离奇、不可能的罪行。你也可以牵连公会中的另一名成员。我们预计杜加什爵士在“揭露”阴谋时会感到沮丧和羞辱。 The Royal Chamberlain hired Sir Dugash of Vert as Thief-Taker. Sir Dugash is on his way here, and will arrive in 5 days. Before he arrives, you need to fabricate and plant evidence of a conspiracy that implicates the mayor and town council in outlandish, impossible crimes. You may implicate one other member of the Guild as well. We expect Sir Dugash to be frustrated and humiliated when he “uncovers” the plot(s).
40	递送包裹。切勿打开。不与任何人讨论包裹内容。包裹内明显传出滴答声。若被问及滴答声，盗贼公会联系人否认听到任何声音，并对这愚蠢问题表现出恼怒。 Deliver the package. Do not open it. Discuss the package with no one. There is a ticking sound quite clearly coming from inside the package. If asked about the ticking sound, the thieves guild contact denies hearing anything and acts annoyed at the silly question.
41	一项专为高手准备的特殊任务！带上这根虚假记忆之线，潜入皇家监狱，将其植入监狱首席审讯官的脑中。这将改变他的记忆，以帮助我们那位慷慨的客户。 A special task for a skilled person! Take this thread of false memory. Break into the royal prison and implant it into the head of the prison's chief interrogator. This will alter his memory and help our very generous client.
42	警长维里德在抓捕公会成员方面过于积极，尽管对警局慈善基金慷慨捐赠，其上级仍无法遏制其过激行为。因此，公会授权成员揭露任何可能让这位好警长重新考虑其狂热行为的丑闻细节。任何能提供相关情报（可信但未必可核实）或引发定罪丑闻的成员，将获得公会的丰厚补偿。 Constable Viread has been overly energetic in apprehending members of the guild, despite generous donations to the Constabulary Benevolence Fund. His higher-ups have been unable to curb his excesses. The Guild therefore authorizes its members to bring to light any salacious details that if brought to the public might cause the good constable to reconsider his zealotry. Any member that can supply relevant information (credible, though not necessarily verifiable) or is responsible for causing an incriminating scandal will be generously compensated by the Guild.
43	“我的朋友，接下来我要告诉你的，仅限于你我之间，绝不可外传。这事对我们来说也非同寻常。”你的导师神秘兮兮地向前倾身，仿佛这样就能避开公会里的耳目。也许他本就想让他们听见。“我怀疑我们中间出了内鬼，[PC]。有人向城卫队泄露了我们对埃斯梅拉达公爵夫人珠宝的计划。”他眯起眼睛看着你，然后咧嘴一笑。“红匕首甚至暗示可能是你。但我向他保证，我对你的信任是值得的。找出真正的罪魁祸首，[PC]，并小心红匕首。” My friend, what I shall tell you now, is between you, me, and no one else. Let's just say this is out of the ordinary, even for us.' Your master leans forward conspiratorially, as if that could stop the eyes and ears of your guild. Maybe he wants them to hear. 'I suspect we have a snitch in our midst, [PC]. Someone who alerted the city watch to our plans regarding Duchess Esmerala's jewelry.' He squints at you, then smirks. 'Red Dagger even suggested it could be you. But I assured him my trust in you is well placed. Find me the true culprit, [PC], and be wary of Red Dagger.'
44	一位收藏家雇佣公会从当地动物园偷走一只稀有野兽——要活的。 A collector has hired the guild to steal a rare beast from a local menagerie - alive.
45	盗贼大赛正在进行。通过在金、胆识、力量、梦想或声望这五个类别中赢得最高奖项，让自己在今年比赛中脱颖而出，成为传奇之一。每次盗窃需附上描述，说明其如何符合所选类别。参赛者可报名多个类别，单项任务可为不同奖项累积积分（例如去年，狐狸阿文将博物馆中的大师画作替换为一张儿童绘制的狐狸画作，赢得了胆识和声望积分），但所有任务必须在一周内完成。报名请见左足阿比。 The Thieving Games are on. Set yourself apart as one of the greats in this year's contest by taking top prize in one of five categories: Gold, Daring, Power, Dreams, or Renown. Each theft should be submitted along with a description of how it fits into the selected category. Contestants may enter multiple categories and individual jobs may award points toward different awards (e.g. last year Arwen the Fox replaced a master painting in the museum with a child's drawing of a fox for points in Daring and Renown), but all jobs must be done within one week. See Abbi Left-Foot to enter.
46	我们派出一组公会成员成功“解放”了一个强盗据点的藏宝。我们有理由相信他们贱卖了战利品，未向公会支付应有的分红。找到他们藏匿的“额外奖励”并带给我们，我们将公平地分你一份战利品。 We sent a group of guild members who successfully 'liberated' a bandit stronghold's stash. We have reason to believe they undersold their haul so they didn't pay proper dividends to the guild. Find where they are storing this 'extra reward' and bring it to us and we will give you a fair cut of the spoils.
47	（对偷窃公会财物的盗贼实施惩罚）‘你的一位兄弟姐妹擅自拿走了本该为家族取回的货物。找些强壮的朋友去‘解释’一下从家族偷窃的后果。别做得太过分，秃鹫盘旋会给你兄弟姐妹带来不必要的麻烦。这是他们的藏身处。’ (Administer a beating to thief stealing from guild) 'One of your brothers/sisters helped him/herself to a bit of shipment he/she was supposed to retrieve for the family. Get some strong friends and 'explain' the consequences of stealing from family. Don't go too far, buzzards circling would bring unwanted heat on your brothers and sisters. Here's their hideout location.'
48	城中有人在进行未经公会批准的鲁莽抢劫。公会雇佣队伍查明犯罪者身份，并在当地黑社会受到过多关注前“劝阻”他们。 Someone in the city is pulling reckless heists, unsanctioned by the Guild. The party is hired to find out who is perpetrating these crimes and to 'discourage' them before too much heat is brought down upon the local underworld.
49	伪装成明天赛马中的5号骑师，确保在最后10码输掉比赛。务必不让任何人怀疑有作弊行为。 Disguise as jockey number 5 in the horse race tomorrow and see that you lose the race on the last 10 yards. Make sure no one suspects cheating.
50	我们许多成员在完成官方认可的任务后不久就被守卫抓走，甚至有人到达目标房屋时发现一群守卫在等他。我们怀疑内部有内鬼。最新受害者是一位以公证人身份过着无懈可击双重生活的人。找出内鬼并将其带给首领。 Many of our members are ending up snatched up by guards soon after completing officially sanctioned jobs, one even arrived at the mark's house to find a group of guards waiting for him. We suspect there is a mole in our midst. The latest casualty is a man who led an airtight second-life as a public notary. Find the mole and bring them to the master.
51	我们最近与附近森林中的一支德鲁伊氏族发生了冲突。正值夏末，树木干燥——我们打算用一场小规模的野火传递信息。进入森林不难，难的是从火海中逃脱并避开它引起的注意。 We've recently come into conflict with a local clan of druids in the nearby forest. It's late summer, the trees are dry -- we're gonna send a message with a little wildfire. The hard part won't be getting into the forest, the hard part will be escaping the blaze and the attention it will attract.
52	一位年轻的学者，光明殿堂的见习生，一直在研究盗贼黑话。在获得毕业长袍之前，他计划在一场公开讲座上展示他的研究成果。虽然很少有人会参加这类讲座，但我们不能冒险让这些信息传播出去！公会已获得一种罕见的影响记忆的血清，专门针对语言学习，应能使其使用任何第二语言时语无伦次。将血清混入他的饮品中，确保其生效——他常去“雀与叉”酒馆。许多学者在繁重的研究压力下崩溃，因此虽然谋杀可能引起怀疑，但他心智失常则不会。然后收集并销毁这位见习生的所有笔记和研究资料，不留一丝痕迹。我们怀疑他的线人是谁，但如果你发现任何指向来源的细节，也请一并上报。 A young scholar, an acolyte to the Halls of Illumination has been studying Thieves Cant. Before he can receive his robes of matriculation, he is scheduled to present his research at a public lecture. While very few people ever show up to these lectures, nonetheless we cannot risk that information being disseminated! The guild has secured a rare memory-affecting serum that specifically targets language learning and which should render all attempts to use secondary languages to gibberish. Introduce the serum in his drink and ensure it has taken effect—he is known to frequent The Finch & Fork. Many a scholar has cracked under the pressure of tedious research, so while a murder might arouse suspicion, his mental faculties abandoning him would not. Then collect and destroy all of the acolyte’s notes and research. Not a scratch should remain. We have our suspicions who might be his informant, but if you discover any details that point to a source, pass that information along as well.
53	国王最近拨出资金重建并扩建下水道系统。你需要说服总工程师，值得他花时间在新下水道系统中添加一些额外设施，包括秘密通道、三个储藏棚（用于走私货物）以及公会的地下总部。 The king has recently set aside funds to rebuild and expand the sewer system. You need to persuade the head engineer that it is worth his time to add some extras to this new sewer system including secret passageways, 3 storage sheds (for smuggling goods) and an underground headquarters for the guild.
54	城里出现了一种新毒品，正在侵蚀我们的市场。我们无法自行销售，也尚未找到幕后主使，因此决定吓跑顾客。我们发现了一个毒品储存点——潜入并下毒或毁掉库存。但不能让人明显看出你动了手脚，因为我们希望这些毒品仍被售出。 There's a new drug in town and it's cutting into our market. We don't think we can start selling it ourselves, and we haven't tracked down the kingpins, so instead we're gonna scare off the customers. We've found one of the drug storage facilities - break in and poison/ruin the stock. But it can't be obvious that you've tampered with the stuff, since we want it to get sold.
55	一位领主最近被毒死。国王将此事归咎于公会（据你所知公会并未参与），并开始逮捕公会成员，封锁已知的公会路线，全面阻止公会业务。你必须查明是谁毒死了领主及其动机，以洗清公会的罪名。 A lord was recently poisoned and died. The King is blaming the guild (which wasn't involved as far as you know) and has been arresting guild members, closing off known guild routes and stopping guild business in its tracks. You have to find out who poisoned the lord and why to clear the name of the guild.
56	“刀锋”雅克连同公会账本一起失踪了。他可能正试图将其卖给敌对公会、当局或其他势力。找到账本并找到雅克。杀了他或将他带回公会接受惩罚。无论如何，别让他把账本卖掉。 Jacq the Blade has gone missing, along with the Guild Ledger. He may be trying to sell it to a rival guild, the authorities or some other party. Find the ledger and find Jacq. Kill him or bring him back to the Guild for punishment. Whatever you do, don't let him sell the ledger off.
57	商人公会正在选举新领袖，任务是确保我们掌握黑料的候选人胜出。 There is an election in the merchants guild as to who leads it. The job is to make sure the winning candidate is the one that we have all the dirt on.
58	PC们收到一封本不该寄给他们的信：“亲爱的朋友，听闻你最近任务顺利，我们再次请求你伪装成纯血蛇人，盗取（插入你的蛇人族或部落）的金色徽章。我们承诺支付360金币作为酬劳，相信你不会让我们失望。”信纸底部绘有一个巨大的符号。 The PCs get a letter that wasn't intended for them: 'Hello dearest friend, we have heard the good news about your latest job. We ask of you one more time, we need you to disguise yourself as a yuan-ti pureblood and steal the golden crest of (INSERT YOUR YUAN-TI CLAN OR TRIBE). We promise you 360 gold pieces for your services, we know you won't fail us.' A large symbol has been drawn at the bottom of the page.
59	递送包裹。切勿打开。不与任何人讨论包裹内容。在递送途中，队伍经过一个算命师的帐篷，那种明显是骗子的可疑人物。但当他们经过时，算命师露出震惊的表情，直盯着装有包裹的背包或次元袋，随即倒地身亡。 Deliver the package. Do not open it. Discuss the package with no one. While on the way to deliver the package, the party passes the tent of a fortune teller, the shady kind that is obviously a fraud. But as they pass by the fortune teller gives them a shocked look, looks directly at whatever backpack or bag of holding contains the package, and then falls over, dead.
60	一个竞争对手——黑帮——已在城中开始活动。他们年轻、贪婪且不够谨慎。其暴力倾向已引起城卫队对所有盗贼的过度关注。更糟的是，他们吓跑了潜在目标，抢走了我们的利润。必须采取行动。全面公会战只会代价更大，街头尸体只会招来城卫队的怒火。需要更隐秘的手段。查明黑帮成员、领导者及其活动据点。除掉其首领，并设局让其余成员要么长期入狱，要么被处以绞刑。 A competing thieves guild - The Black Club - has started operating in the city. They're young, greedy and not very subtle. Their propensity for violence has brought an uncomfortable amount of attention from the City Watch on all thieves. What's worse, they are scaring off potential marks and pulling profit from our pockets. Something has to be done. An all out guild war would only be more costly, and bodies showing up in the street will only bring down the wrath of the Watch. A more subtle approach is needed. Find out who The Black Club are, who leads them and where they operate from. Kill their leader and set up the rest of them so that the Watch either puts them in jail for a long time, or calls in the hangman.
61	卡吉里普尔苏丹有意为他的私人动物园获取以下生物，而这些生物恰好目前居住在我们美丽城市的皇家动物园内：一对螺旋角跳山羊、一窝彩虹飞蛇、一只无胡须冰龙、一条虚幻催眠眼镜蛇，以及一只被称为地爪猫的猫科动物。由于其中一些动物是沃尔维塔公主的珍爱，因此行事需极为谨慎。 The Sultan of Kadjripoor is interested in acquiring the following creatures for his menagerie that so happen to currently reside in the Royal Zoological Garden in our fair city: A pair of spiral-horned skitter goats, a clutch of iridescent flying snakes, a flightless bearded ice drake, an ethereal hypnotic cobra, and one specimen of felis caudaglobosa AKA a digmaul. Since a number of these animals are personally prized by the Princess Volveta, discretion is highly encouraged.
62	国王的金英里赛——王国最富有的赛马赛事——将于三天后举行。公会会长的马匹——静影——是参赛的十二匹马之一。奖金高达10,000金币，公会已利用其在赌场的影响力，确保静影的赔率有利。赛局已被操控，公会已确保八匹马不会获胜。只需再搞定三匹马，就能确保静影轻松夺冠。这就是你的任务。你可以对马主、训练师或骑师进行贿赂、恐吓、暴力或施法，或是传统的马匹干扰，或其他任何手段，但务必让静影获胜。当它夺冠时，公会会长将慷慨地奖励你。 The King's Golden Mile - the richest horse race in the kingdom - is due to be held in three days. The guildmaster's horse - Silent Shadow - is one of a dozen competing. The prize is 10,000gp and the guild has used its pull with the bookies to make sure the odds on Shadow are favorable. The fix is on. The guild has used its sway to make sure that eight of the runners aren't going to win. That only leaves three more horses to fix to ensure an easy victory for Shadow. That's where you come in. You can use bribery, intimidation, violence or magic on the owners, trainers or jockeys, good old fashioned horse nobbling, or any other method you want, but make sure that Silent Shadow wins. The guildmaster will reward you handsomely when he does.
63	一位高阶法师的学徒偷走了一件强大的魔法物品后逃之夭夭。追踪学徒，获取戒指并带回。若能活捉学徒，还可获得额外报酬。 The apprentice of a high wizard has stolen a powerful magical item and ran off. Track down the apprentice, acquire the ring and bring it back. Bonus payment if you bring back the apprentice alive, too.
64	作为一名优秀的盗贼，你被委派调查一起盗窃案！有人从公会的一个金库中偷走了一件物品，你的任务是查明是谁以及如何做到的。 As a good thief, you are tasked with investigating a theft! Someone has stolen an item from one of the vaults of the guild and it is up to you to find out who and how.
65	公会的一名年轻成员无意中从公会一位强大且复仇心重的盟友那里偷走了一件心爱的神器。在他们发现之前，潜入其住所并归还物品。 One of the younger members of the guild unknowingly stole a beloved artifact from a powerful, and vengeful, ally of the guild. Break into their house and return the item before it is missed.
66	在公共场所清除盗贼标记而不被发现。（可选：抓住留下标记的小混混。）“某个无赖在各种建筑上刻下了误导和错误的盗贼标记——在拥有解离魔杖的敏锐巫师店铺上刻‘易下手’，在死胡同巷子里刻‘逃生’，在守卫家中刻‘销赃’。仅这周我们就不得不保释了三个新手！清除列出的所有地点的标记。如果找到那个无赖，尽量活捉，完好无损为可选。” (Erase thieves' marks without being caught in public. Optional: Catch punk leaving them. ) 'Some rascal has been carving misleading and incorrect thieves' marks on various structures - 'easy mark' on the shop of the sharp-eyed wizard with a disintegration wand, 'escape' on a dead-end alley, 'fence' on the home of a guardsman. We've had to bail 3 novices out of jail this week alone! Erase all the marks at the locations listed. If you find the rascal, bring him in alive, if possible. Good condition is optional.'
67	奥特科特男爵长期以来一直是国家集体的眼中钉。我们已对其商业利益发动了数月的攻势，而你正是助力此事的绝佳人选。男爵在即将到来的赛马比赛中押下了巨额赌注，我们想让他输个精光。我们得知他一直在收买骑师和贿赂官员，但我们要比他更胜一筹。这是小白帽，她是一位德鲁伊和出色的演员。你需要将她偷偷带入男爵的马厩，同时将男爵的赛马“炽热闪电”偷运出来。比赛结束后，你们需要再次调换她们的位置。她会让比赛看起来势均力敌，并在最后一刻以令人心碎的方式输掉比赛…… The Baron Autcort has been a thorn in the country's collective backside for too long. We have been waging war on his business interests for months now, and you are perfect to help. The Baron has wagered a considerable sum of money on an upcoming horse race, and we would like him to lose it. We know that he has been working to buy off jockeys and bribe officials, but we are going to do him one better. This is Little Whitecap. She is a druid and exceptional actress. You need to smuggle her into the Baron's stable and smuggle the Baron's horse, Searing Bolt, out. Then you need to switch their places again after the race. She will make it close and lose in a heartbreak at the very end...
68	（对合唱团使用喷嚏粉以找回失控的风元素。）“这个嘛……算是个特殊任务。我们一直用来从内部解锁复杂保险库的珍贵风元素，在一场与合唱团彩排重叠的豪宅盗窃中，因一次糟糕的静电惊吓而逃走了。结果，我们的安全谈判员不得不空手提前撤离。据一位可靠的先知透露，那风元素正藏身于一位合唱团成员的肺里。合唱团的主要公演就在明天，之后他们就会各奔东西。我们只有一次机会。这是一袋喷嚏粉，只要让风元素触碰到瓶子就能把它收回来。这事儿没法悄悄进行，所以动作要快，完事后迅速撤离。我们在城外的小屋碰头。” (Use sneezing powder on a singing group to retrieve a wayward air elemental.) 'This one is a ... uh ... specialty job. A valuable air elemental we've been using to unlock tricky vaults from the inside got frightened by a nasty static shock and bolted during a mansion heist that overlapped with a choir practice recital. Thanks to that, our safetalker had to leave early and empty-handed. We've got word from a competent seer that the elemental is laying low in one of the choir member's lungs. The choir's main public performance is tomorrow, and then the group splits up a hundred ways. We have one chance. Here's a sack of sneezing powder. Just get the elemental to touch the bottle to get it back in. There's no way to do this quietly, so just get it over with quickly and bounce. We'll rendezvous at a cabin out of town.'
69	一名前警卫用他从平民税款中贪污的退休金开了家面包店。据说，他年老昏聩，日复一日地抱怨有人“偷了他的甜面包卷”，这为盗贼公会提供了完美的掩护。幸运的是，由于旧日冒险中的伤，这位前警卫走路一瘸一拐，行动迟缓且神志不清。然而，有传言称，他为了保护面包店，雇用了现役城市警卫，并设置了魔法陷阱来防范盗贼。任务：偷走他下一批甜面包卷，归还给镇民。避免被发现，让镇上继续认为他疯了。让这位老人破产，将他的财富归还公会，分发给平民。 An ex-guard has recently opened a bakery with his retirement money, embezzled from the taxes of the common folk. Word is, in his senility he claims day-in and day-out that someone has been “stealing his sweet rolls.” This has created a perfect alibi for the guild. Fortunately, due to an old adventuring injury, the ex-guard walks with a limp and is slow as well as senile. However his defenses for this bakery have been rumored to include currently-enrolled city guards and enchantments/booby traps to deter thieves. Steal the next shipment of his sweet rolls and return them to the townspeople. Avoid detection. The town must continue to think he is going mad. Bankrupt this old man and return his wealth to the guild for distribution to the common-folk.
70	我们位于下水道的储藏室和安全屋被穴居人占领了。不久他们就会引起地上居民的注意，随之而来的还有法律。如果这个地方被发现，将严重妨碍我们的走私活动。让我们为城市做件好事，同时保护我们的利益。清除下水道中的穴居人以及你发现的任何其他人。我们指的是所有人。这次别心慈手软。 Our store room and safehouse in the sewers have been overrun by troglodytes. It won't be long before they attract the attention of the citizens above ground, and with them the law. If the space were discovered, it would seriously hamper our smuggling activities. Let's do the city a service and protect our interests at the same time. Clear out the sewers of troglodytes and anyone else who you find. And we mean everyone. No bleeding hearts for this one.
71	通过挑起酒吧斗殴来分散城市守卫的注意力。别担心其他事——我们会处理，你将轻松获得50金币。 Distract the city watch for a while by starting a bar brawl. Don't worry about the rest - we'll take care of it, and you'll get an easy 50 gold pieces.
72	我们的一名特工“扒手”在执行任务时失踪了。我们最后一次联系到他时，他正在渗透“末日典范”——一个最近成立并在该地区因暴力行为而声名狼藉的末日教派。你将伪装成该教派的新成员，试图营救“扒手”，假设他还活着。若教派成员表现出暴力倾向，可对其使用致命武力。 One of our agents, Pickpocket, has disappeared while on a mission. The last time we had any contact with them was when they were infiltrating Paragons of the End, an apocalyptic cult that was recently formed and gained a reputation for recent violence within the area. You will go undercover as initiates within the cult and attempt to rescue Pickpocket, assuming that they are still alive. Lethal force is authorized against cult members in cases where they seem to become violent.
73	递送包裹。切勿打开。不与任何人谈论包裹。包裹虽小却异常沉重，无论携带者体能如何或环境温度高低，都会使其大汗淋漓。 Deliver the package. Do not open it. Discuss the package with no one. The package is unusually heavy for its small size and causes whoever is carrying it to sweat profusely regardless of their fitness or the ambient temperature.
74	那艘船明天就要离港，我不希望它再回来。破坏船体、杀死船员、放火——随你怎么做。如果船在海上远离目击者时被摧毁，你还能得到额外奖励。 That ship is leaving harbor tomorrow and I don't want it to ever return. Break the hull, kill the crew, set a fire - whatever you decide. You'll get a bonus if the ship isn't destroyed until it's out at sea, away from witnesses.
75	我们正设法在当局找到他之前将一位客户送出城。但问题是——他是个幽灵，追捕他的是教会当局。他们用魔法结界将他困住，但他若能附身于活人体内，就能绕过结界。潜入地下墓穴，让他附身，然后出城。他会通过告诉你生前藏钱的地点作为报酬。如果他动了继续附身的歪念头，就用这张卷轴对付他。 We're trying to get a client out of town before the authorities find him. Here's the twist -- he's a ghost, it's the church authorities that're after him. They've got him fenced in with magic wards, but he can bypass them if he's possessing a living body. Get into the catacombs, get possessed, get out of town. He will pay by telling you where he hid his money in life. If he gets any funny ideas about continued possession, use this scroll.
76	我们最近的一个受害者变成了鬼魂，而且不幸的是，她属于那种能说话而不是只会呻吟和哀嚎的鬼魂。你需要去再次解决她……在她向太多人透露她死亡的真相之前。如果你的团队对付不了灵体，我们有个法师联系人可以帮忙。但他并不是个硬汉，所以在他进行仪式时，你需要保护他。 One of our recent victims has come back as a ghost, and unfortunately she's one of those ghosts who can actually talk instead of just moaning and wailing. You need to go get rid of her... again... before she can tell too many people about the circumstances of her death. If your crew can't deal with spirits, we've got a magician contact who can help. But he's not exactly a tough guy, so you'd need to protect him while he does the ritual.
77	公会最近接连失手，据兄弟们打探，夜间有东西在外游荡，闯入巫师商店，引得守卫出动。本以为那些魔法陷阱能挡住宵小，谁知这东西悄无声息地进出，如鼠般敏捷。然而，你也知道，守卫增多，巡逻频繁，生意可就难做了。我们查了码头的“鼠帮”和山里的“蠢蛋”，他们都没认账（老实说，他们也没那本事干出这种事）。现在轮到你出马了，出去找到那个捣乱的家伙。 The Guild has had a string of recent acquisitions go bad. Best we can gather from the boys is that something is prowling around out there at night, breaking into wizard shops and causing the guards to be called. You'd think all these arcane entrapments would keep ne'er do wells out - turns out whatever this thing is is slipping in and out, quiet like a mouse. However, as you know, more guards can quickly ruin a night of business with all the patrols and all. We checked with the Bilgerats at the docks and the Dunders out in the hills, neither of them are claiming anything (and frankly I don't think they have the ... sophistication to pull something like that off. Here's where you come in. Go out there, and find me whoever is causing it.
78	战争正在耗尽我们用于润滑门铰、保养匕首以及保持头发光滑专业的油料储备。给我们带来30瓶油。我们不需要知道来源，我们将以市场价的双倍支付。 The war is depleting stocks of oil which we need for greasing hinges, maintaining our daggers, and keeping our hair looking slick and professional. Bring us 30 bottles of oil. We don't need to know the source. We'll pay you double the usual market price.
79	红盗贼，又称胭脂盗贼，是多年前销声匿迹的臭名昭著的大盗，在垂暮之年向盗贼公会提出最后一次盗窃请求，目标为市政厅。目标人物？市长，红盗贼自其盗窃生涯开始以来的终身宿敌。任务内容？烧毁建筑顶层的市长阳台，将红盗贼的披风升起在旗杆上代替市旗，最后：偷走市长座椅，这是他最钟爱的物品。报酬？可能极为丰厚；关于红盗贼藏匿其著名宝藏——他传奇财富的全部——位置的线索，若能找到，尽可取走。但有个条件？尽管红盗贼年事已高且健康欠佳，仍希望亲自参与此次行动。你将带着一个累赘行动。 The Red Rogue, also known as Rogue Rouge, an infamous master thief who disappeared years ago, has approached the guild in his dying days for one last heist before he dies. The target? City Hall. Mark? The mayor, Rogue Rouge's lifelong archrival since his thieving days started. The score? Burning the mayoral veranda atop the building, raise the Red Rogue's cape on the flagpole instead of the city flag, and lastly: steal the mayoral chair, his absolute favorite. The reward? Possibly bountiful; a clue to where Rogue Rouge keeps his famous stash - the entirety of his legendary wealth - free for the taking, if you can find it. The catch? Rogue Rouge wants to join in on the heist with you, despite his many age- and health-related issues. You'll be playing with a handicap.
80	上周，一群冒险者途经城镇，如常般制造了混乱与破坏。在骚乱中，警署被彻底摧毁。昨夜，警长与市长商定在库珀街设立新警署。新址最近的酒馆是“诚实商人”，其地下室正是我们辉煌组织的所在地。你需要从木匠公会偷取建筑图纸，以便我们的伪造师修改，让警长改变选址决定，或为我们找到新地点。 Last week, a group of adventurers came through town, causing havoc and mayhem as they are wont to do. In the chaos, the guardhouse was completely destroyed. Last night, the guard captain and the mayor agreed on a new location for the guardhouse along Cooper Street. The nearest tavern to their new location is the Honest Merchant, the basement of which houses our illustrious organization. We need you to steal the construction plans from the Carpenters' Guild so our forger can alter them, make the guard captain change his mind about location, or find us a new location.
81	在繁忙的市场中，将100张与公会结盟的商家的传单悄无声息地放入人们的口袋。 In a busy market, plant 100 flyers for a business allied to the guild in people's pockets without them noticing.
82	有幅名画，众所周知是赝品，两位贵族表亲每年都会轮流拥有它。当前持有者会委托公会潜入对方家中挂上此画。当地警局也参与其中，若被抓只会被关在醉汉拘留室一晚并没收佣金，但最好别有任何未结的逮捕令让警局追查。 There's this painting, it's a well known forgery, and there are these two noble cousins. Every year the cousin who currently has the painting commissions the guild to sneak it into the other cousin's house and hang it up. The local guardhouse is in on it, so if you get caught it's only an overnight in the drunk tank and forfeiting the promised commission, but you'd better not have any outstanding warrants for the guardhouse to follow up on.
83	一群著名的赏金猎人来到镇上，我们不知道他们此行的目的。我们曾试图建立联系，但派去的人接近时被杀。查明他们的计划。若他们因我们而来，你有权将其击杀。 A group of famous bounty hunters have come to town, we don't know what their goal is here. We already tried to establish contact but our man was killed when he tried to approach them. Find out what they are planning. If they are here because of us, you have the permission to kill them.
84	传闻中传说中的黑乌鸦雕像在城中出现。查明谁拥有它，它被存放在何处，并为我们偷来！（雕像可能是赝品，除非它并非赝品，那样的话它就被诅咒了）（灵感源自《英雄传说》系列中的一个持续剧情） It's rumored that the fabled Black Raven is in town. Find out who has it, where is it being kept, and steal it for us! (The statuette is a fake, unless it isn't, in which case it's cursed) (Loosely based on a continuing arch in the Quest for Glory series)
85	我们注意到，公会过去十年间销赃的艺术品中至少有一半是由半身人埃达尔奎克·锐眼伪造的。虽然公会会长维尼克斯对锐眼的天赋深感钦佩，但这给公会造成了巨大损失，更重要的是损害了我们的声誉。请向锐眼大师传达他所欠债务的严重性。他可以通过为公会工作来偿还债务，或者以生命为代价。此外，执行此任务并发现原画作下落的成员可保留最终销售价值的一部分。 It's come to our attention that at least half of the artwork the guild has fenced in the past decade have been forgeries painted by the Halfling Edalquick Keeneye. While Guildmaster Venix is highly impressed with the genius of the Keeneye's talent, it has cost the guild an enormous sum and more importantly hurt our reputation. Please impress upon Master Keeneye the magnitude of his debt. He can pay off his debt by working for the guild or he can pay with his life. In addition, members who carry out this task and can discover the location of the original artwork can retain a portion of value of the final sale.
86	有人需要闭嘴，公会需要陷害此人。闯入其家中，用伪造的财务文件替换原文件，显示其欺诈行为。 Someone needs to be shut up, the guild needs to frame the person. Break into their home and replace financial documents with forged ones that show fraud.
87	我们的一位会计（镇上的富商）最近购置了一处远超出其财力范围的庄园。我们怀疑他从我们的交易中窃取了资金。查明他如何获得如此巨款，以及是否在偷我们的钱。 One of our accountants (a wealthy merchant in town) has recently bought a new estate that should be way out of his league. We suspect him to have stolen money from our transactions. Find out about how he got that much money and if he's stealing from us.
88	我们邻国的两位大使即将在阿拉什海沙漠的中立地带会面。若他们结成联盟，我们将面临大麻烦。前往阿拉什海，不惜一切手段破坏这次会面！ Two ambassadors of our neighboring kingdoms are about to meet on neutral ground, in the desert of Arash'hai. If they forge an alliance, we would have a big problem. Travel to Arash'hai and sabotage the meeting by any means!
89	传说中，传奇盗贼阿格尼·锤窃曾从众神手中盗取了我们锻造炉的第一缕火焰。你的最终考核是重复这场“劫案”，从一座被龙族占据的废弃山庙中偷取一枚熔岩蠕虫蛋。 It was said that the legendary Agni Hammerthief once stole the first flames for our forges from the Gods themselves. Your final exam is to repeat this 'heist' by stealing a lava wyrm egg from an abandoned mountain temple that has been settled by a dragon brood.
90	即将有一场[公开、锦标赛、艺术、射箭、长矛、赛跑]活动，我们需要你当众羞辱一位深受观众喜爱的人物。 There is a [public, tournament, arts, archery, lancing, racing] event coming up that we need you to humiliate someone very popular with the crowd. The [king,
