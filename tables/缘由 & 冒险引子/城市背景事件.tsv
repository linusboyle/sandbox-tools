Instead, an alchemist has gotten a little too eager and mixed dangerous chemicals. He's still inside the shop where the smoke is billowing from, and will die if not rescued...

34	盗贼公会正在从遗产拍卖中行窃。他们盯上了刚去世的富有贵族，混入拍卖会和房产交易。他们似乎抢走了许多小摆设和低价值魔法物品，但无人知晓其目的。实际上，他们在寻找一个很久以前被一群老派冒险家分散的拼图立方体。当拼合完整时，它将揭示一个传说中满是财富的地牢。 The thieves guild is stealing from estate sales. They find rich, recently dead posh folks and drop by at auctions and property sales. They seem to be nabbing a lot of nick-knacks and low value magic items, but nobody can figure out why. In reality, they are searching for a puzzle cube that had been divided up long ago by a bunch of old society adventurers. When put together, it reveals a dungeon rumored to be rife with riches.

47	皇室成员间的一段三角恋情出了岔子。其中一位恋人的秘密轻则令王室蒙羞，重则可能被用于敲诈勒索。部分秘密已在街头巷尾悄然流传，更大的、更危险的秘密也即将曝光。 A love triangle has gone awry amongst two members of the royal court. One of the lovers has secrets that could embarrass the monarchy at best, or be used for purposes of blackmail at worst. Some of those secrets have already been whispered in the streets, and it's only a short time before bigger ones leak out too. Dangerous ones.
48	国王公然挥霍税收，明目张胆地实施腐败计划，使皇家住所更加奢华。民众决定在未来一周内采取行动，街头紧张气氛已开始升温。 The King flagrantly wastes taxes in a visibly corrupt scheme to make the royal quarters even more lavish. The populace decides to do something about it over the coming week, and tensions are already starting to simmer in the streets.
49	卫兵们不知为何开始拦截并检查所有出城货物，这严重影响了货运并导致交通堵塞。实际上，盗贼公会在一场惊天大劫案中从至高巫师那里偷走了一件珍贵的魔法物品。问题是，由于全城戒严，他们现在无法将其运出城外。 The Guards have been stopping and inspecting all outbound cargo, for some reason. It is putting a real strain on shipments and clogging up the traffic. In reality, the thieves guild managed to steal a precious magical artifact from the Supreme Wizard during an epic heist. Trouble is, they can't get it out of the city now with all the heat.

There were many casualties, and even the bride and groom both attempted to kill each other. This has happened at least once before, recently, and it has people on edge- leery of outsiders.
51	一只疯狂的怪物在逃窜，据说它喜欢在深夜穿越屋顶并扑向路人。无论传言真假，今晚城市卫队都实施了宵禁：天黑后任何人不得上街。 There's a crazed monster on the loose, that likes to run across rooftops and jump on folks in the dead of night, or so the rumors say. Rumor or not- the city guard is imposing a curfew tonight: nobody in the streets after dark.
52	一起重大造假行动将在1d4+1天内被揭露。该行动可能已暗中运作数月，大量假金币和银币流入当地经济。再次流通假币的惩罚极为严厉。（玩家在过去两次会话中获得的金币中有10%被发现是假币）。 A major counterfeiting operation gets uncovered in 1d4+1 days. There's a chance that it was operating undetected for months, and a significant amount of fools gold and silver coins entered the local economy. Penalties for re-circulating the fake money are very harsh. (10% of player gold gained in the last two sessions turns out to be phony).
53	城市对恶行进行了严厉打击，上个月酒精被明令禁止！私酒仍能找到，但只能在极度隐秘下以高价交易。 There's been a real crackdown on Vice in the city, and alcohol was outlawed last month! Bootleg can still be found, but only under heavy secrecy and for high dollar.
54	关于即将到来的渔民罢工的传言四处流传。由于一系列因故意不安全的工作条件导致的死亡事件，城市的工人们忍无可忍，呼吁经济民主。如果玩家无法以某种方式提供帮助，将在2d6+1天内爆发骚乱。 Whispers are everywhere about an impending fisherman's strike. After a string of fatalities due to deliberately unsafe working conditions, the city's workers are fed up and are calling for economic democracy. If the players can't help somehow, rioting starts in 2d6+1 days.
55	城中最大住宅区的租户们正联合起来进行租金罢工，以抗议不安全的生活条件及房东持续的权力滥用。房东拥有一支商船队，并威胁不向参与抗议的租户出售必需的药品和食物。局势正变得紧张。 Tenants in the city's largest housing block are gathering together for a rent strike to oppose unsafe conditions and their landlord's continued abuse of power. The landlord owns a fleet of merchant ships and is threatening to not sell necessary medicine and food to renters who participate in the protest. It's getting ugly.
56	城镇市场中央将在1d8+2天后发生塌陷。镇上仅有的资源只能开始清理废墟，暂时无力调查塌陷原因，这为玩家角色提供了探索的机会。 A cave-in is about to occur in 1d8+2 days in the middle of the town’s market. The town has only the resources to begin picking up the pieces, not investigate the cave-in just yet, leaving the PCs free to explore.
57	一位皇室婴儿将在1d20+5天后出生，传闻这孩子并非国王亲生…… A royal child is about to be born in 1d20+5 days, and rumor has it the child is not the king’s...
58	一艘船抵达港口，但船上空无一人…… A ship arrives at port, but no one is on the ship...
59	镇议会成员的长子们将在1d6+3天后被发现死在神庙前，尸体的排列似乎是一次失败的仪式尝试。 The firstborn children of each of the town’s council members show up dead in front of the temple in 1d6+3 days. The arraignment of the bodies appears to be a failed attempt at some kind of ritual.
60	城镇的水源正在缓慢流失，无人知晓原因。1d6+2天后，巨大的根须从地底冒出，缠绕建筑，造成混乱和严重的基础设施破坏。实际上，这一切是由当地一个秘密社团引发的，只有他们才能解除自己释放的灾难。 The town’s water supply is draining slowly, and no one knows why. In 1d6+2 days, humongous roots sprout from the ground and twist through the buildings, causing havoc and massive infrastructure damage. In reality, this was caused by a local Secret Society, and only they can undo what they have unleashed.
61	每隔几天，一位德鲁伊带着他的同伴走进城市。他坚信有人正在打开通往深渊的传送门，将死亡带到他附近的林地……但实际上，这只是城市本身的污染在影响林地。 A druid wanders into the city every few days with his companion. He is convinced that someone is opening a portal to the abyss and bringing death to his nearby grove... but it's only being affected by actual pollution from the city itself.
62	一名纵火犯在城内活动。城镇守卫正在调查，但至今未透露任何线索。每过[1d6+2]天，就会发生一起新的火灾。（可通过让火灾发生在玩家角色曾到访的地点来加剧紧张感。） An arsonist is in town. The town guard is investigating but so far haven't let on that they have any leads. Every [1d6+2] days a new fire is started. (Amp this up by having the fires be places the PCs have visited...)
63	城市墓地中藏有一只隐秘的异兽，若未被发现，一个由商人组成的邪教团体将每隔[1d4]天让一名市民消失。在[1d10+10]人失踪后，更大事件将发生。[1. 僵尸爆发 2. 远古邪恶复苏 3. 随机野魔法涌动 4. 多人失去对近期失踪者的记忆] The city's graveyard has a hidden cryptid, and if not found, an occultist group of merchants will make a citizen disappear every [1d4] days.

Various people lose memory of the recent missing ones]

65	城卫队正忙着四处张贴失踪儿童的告示。如果玩家角色在[2d4]天内调查此事，可以找到被埋在墓地中但还活着的孩子。否则，城卫队稍后会在墓中发现已死的孩子，棺材内部有抓痕。无论哪种情况，都会引发关于是谁故意埋葬了这孩子及其动机的怀疑... The town guard are busy putting around posters of a missing kid. If the PCs look into it [2d4] days, the child can be found alive, buried in the graveyard. Otherwise, the child is later found dead in the grave by the city guard with scratch marks on the inside of the coffin. In either case, suspicions arise over who deliberately buried this child, and why...
66	镇上的所有猫开始将市场当作猫砂盆使用。[1d20]天后，一种奇怪的疾病开始流行，商人们病得足以导致经济开始关闭。疾病蔓延后，玩家们将发现所有商店都关门了。 All the cats in town start to use the market as a litter box. After [1d20] days, an epidemic of a strange disease starts that makes merchants get sick enough that they begin closing down the economy. After the disease spreads, the PCs will find no shops open.
67	公主即将与邻国王子进行政治联姻，但传闻她与一位本地平民吟游诗人相恋已久。宫廷内外和街头巷尾都在猜测他们计划在婚礼前私奔，而婚礼就在一周后。这正是他们的计划。他们需要帮助悄无声息地离开城市，而国王则重金悬赏阻止这一阴谋的人。 The Princess is facing an arranged marriage to a nearby kingdom's Prince, but it has been rumored she's been in a relationship with a local bard commoner for some time & some folks at Court & in the street are speculating that they plan to run away before the wedding, which is to happen in 1 week. That is EXACTLY what they plan to do. They want help getting out of town unseen, while the King would handsomely reward someone who stopped this plot.
68	当地邪教夜间在下水道进行恶魔仪式，献祭乞丐，白天则通过他们拥有的酒馆将人肉供给民众。随着时间推移，越来越多的人眼神呆滞、神情恍惚，身上出现邪教标志的新纹身。在2d20天后，邪教的新军队将试图刺杀国王。 A local cult is sacrificing beggars in fiendish rituals down in the sewers at night, then by day is serving the flesh to the populace via a tavern they own. As the days go on, more and more people can be seen glassy-eyed and dreamy, with fresh tattoos depicting the cult's symbol. In 2d20 days, the cult's new army will make an attempt on the King's life.

71	明天起，天气反常地变冷，且日复一日愈发严寒。法师塔率先被冻结成冰，冰层似乎正从塔中向外蔓延，而自寒潮开始以来，无人再见过那位法师... It becomes unseasonably cold tomorrow, and each day it just keeps. Getting. Colder. The wizard's tower is the first place to freeze solid with ice that seems to be emanating outward from it, and no-one has seen the wizard since the cold snap began...
72	王室婴儿在玩家抵达前刚刚出生，全城装饰着无数美丽的花朵。公众对新生命的消息焦急万分，期盼早日见到这位小王子或小公主。 A royal baby was born just before the PCs arrived, and the town is decorated with millions of beautiful flowers. The public is antsy for news of the new arrival and hopes to see the little one soon.
73	今夜，当玩家们沉睡时，城市卫兵将开始围捕所有[背景]人士进行审讯。（如侍僧、学者、异乡人、士兵等）。他们收到情报，称当地秘密社团一直在利用[背景]人士推进其目标，国王已准备采取极端措施确保他们的计划失败。 Tonight as the PCs sleep, the city guard will begin rounding up all [Background]s for interrogation. (Acolytes, sages, outlanders, soldiers, etc). They received intelligence that the local secret society has been using [Background]s to further their goals, and the King is ready to take drastic measures to ensure their plans fail.
74	鼠患肆虐，无处不在。市民因老鼠的频繁活动和抓挠声难以入眠，街头乞丐开始显现病态。1d10天后，一位德鲁伊现身，声称能清除城市鼠患，但其真实意图更为险恶。 Rats are getting out of hand- they are EVERYWHERE. The people can hardly sleep with all the movement and scratching, and beggars in the streets are starting to look diseased. In 1d10 days, a druid shows up claiming to be able to rid the city of rats, but his true intentions are much more sinister.
75	又一位富有的贵族今日身亡，其年轻妻子将继承全部财产。奇怪的是，这已是她第三次守寡，且每次的亡夫都是城中的富豪。她最新亡夫的儿子正寻求雇佣人手，调查她是否涉嫌不轨。 Another rich nobleman has turned up dead today and his young wife is inheriting all of his wealth. The odd thing is this is the third time she’s been widowed and always to wealthy men in the city. Her latest husband’s son is seeking to hire someone to search for evidence of foul play on her part.
76	一位著名治疗师即将到访，全城因他所助之人而对他痴迷不已。他只为钱财而来，却无人能说服公众相信这一点——他们对他爱戴至极。 A famous healer is coming to town and the whole community is obsessed with him because of everyone he’s helped. He is only in it for the money, but nobody can convince the public of that- they absolutely love the guy.
77	[1d6]天前，一颗陨石击中了城墙外，人们一直在努力获取陨石的珍贵碎片出售，但最大的一块却神秘失踪。城里每个人都在寻找它，甚至包括城市守卫。 [1d6] days ago a meteorite hit just outside the city walls, and people have been trying hard to get valuable pieces of the meteorite to sell off but the biggest piece of all was mysteriously taken. Everyone in town is on the lookout for it, even the city guardsmen.
78	王子并非国王亲生。这一真相将在[1d4]天内揭晓，届时国王将下令公开处决深受爱戴的王后。若她真的被处死，民众将悲痛欲绝。 The Prince is NOT the son of the King. This will come to light in [1d4] days, at which time the King will call for the public execution of the beloved Queen. The public will be devastated if she is actually killed.

At midnight, citizens gather to light mini lanterns that float up into the sky. The old timers recant how the lanterns are to lead missing travelers and long lost loved ones home.

There’s a 10% chance that a hole will appear below where the party is resting, waking them up.
84	一道清晰的德鲁伊信息出现在天空中，所有人都能看到，但无人知晓其含义。这条信息在[1d4]天后消失，此时两个不同德鲁伊圈之间的秘密战斗结束，城外仅留下中立的智慧植物。 A clear Druid message has appeared in the sky, something all people can see, but no one knows its meaning. The message disappears after [1d4] days, when the secret battle between two different druid circles ends, leaving only neutral sentient plants outside the city.
85	有人撰写并在城中散布了关于一些守卫多年前未能保护民众的严酷真相。民众愤怒，要求正义，但在[1d8+1]天后，有人会发现这是假消息，实为越狱的掩护。 Somebody has written and spread around the city a harsh truth about some guards who failed in protecting the people a long time ago. The people are furious and want justice, but in [1d8+1] days someone will discover it was fake information used as a cover for a prison break.
86	城市中发生了一件怪事：人们在街上行走时会迷路，但[1d12]小时后却到达了目的地，这令人极为困惑。有20%的几率会发生在一位或多位玩家身上。这是一位强大法师在秘密研究如何操控时间所致，但在[1d4+3]天后，她将被自己创造的反向时间停止法术困住（只有她被冻结在时间中），公众所受的影响也将结束。 Something strange is happening in the city: people claim to become lost when walking down the street, but reach their destination [1d12] hours later, which is extremely confusing. There’s a 20% chance of this happening to one or more players. This is the effect of a powerful mage trying to learn how to manipulate time in secret, but in [1d4+3] days she will be stuck in a reverse time-stop spell of her own creation (only she is frozen in time), and the effects on the public will end.
87	一位快乐的半身人正在向每个听它故事的人分发幸运币。故事因人而异，因为这位半身人是一位神祇，试图激励并帮助那些将在未来悲剧中需要力量的人们。 A cheerful Halfling is giving lucky coins to everyone who listens to its story. The story changes for everyone, since the Halfling is a deity trying to inspire and help people who will need it to survive a future tragedy.
88	王子迎娶了一位美杜莎，这一出人意料的举动在民众中引发了混乱。几天后，公主又透露她嫁给了一位狼人而非塔布西猫人。众人皆不知所措。 The prince is marrying a Medusa, something no one expected and is causing confusion among the population. Days later, the princess reveals she has married a weretiger instead of a Tabaxi. No one is sure how to react.
89	一家久负盛名的餐厅因老板“灵感枯竭”即将关闭。它将在[1d4]天内最后一次售卖美食，部分幸运顾客将获得其秘传的著名食谱！预计排队情况将异常疯狂。 A long famous restaurant is closing since the owner “has no more inspiration.” It'll be selling food one last time in [1d4] days, and some lucky customers will receive one of its secret famous recipes! The lines are expected to be ridiculous.
90	城市的水源遭到污染。无论是蓄意投毒、意外污染，还是（有人推测）可能的软泥怪入侵，目前尚无人能确定确切原因。 The city's water source becomes tainted. By deliberate poison, accidental pollution, or (some speculate) a possible ooze infestation, no one is quite sure yet what the cause is exactly yet.
91	一辆满载各种货物的商车因过重压垮桥梁，坠入下方河流。交通被迫改道，但由于桥梁维修期间的额外拥堵，城市内的通行时间将延长[1d10+3]天。商人丢失了顺流而下的一件珍贵物品，希望有人能将其找回，但物品可能已流入下水道…… A merchant cart carrying various goods was too heavy for a bridge and collapsed into the river below. Traffic is being rerouted, but travel times through the city are doubled for [1d10+3] days due to the extra congestion while the bridge is repaired. The merchant lost something of great value downstream and wishes to have it returned, but it may have traveled into the sewers...
92	一场严重的瘟疫在城中蔓延，似乎源自城市的富裕区域。病患日渐增多，街道上挤满了病人。在[1d20+5]天内，所有商铺将因工人病倒而关闭。此时瘟疫的源头已无关紧要——城市急需的是解药！ A very bad blight has spread through the city seeming to emanate from the nicer side of town. Sick people begin filling the streets more and more each day. In [1d20+5] days all the businesses will close as the workers are too sick. The source of this affliction is irrelevant at this point- what the city NEEDS is a cure!
93	城镇守卫故意放任某些区域的犯罪活动猖獗，使国王声名受损。这是为了抗议被拒绝加薪的原则问题吗？还是守卫队长与领袖之间的个人恩怨？是否有未知第三方资助的贿赂发生？或者他们只是不称职，但由于[剧情原因]没有更好的人选替代？ The town guards are intentionally allowing crime to run rampant in certain areas which is giving the King a bad reputation. Is this a matter of principle to protest a refused pay raise? Perhaps a personal vendetta between the guard captain and the leader? Has some kind of payoff occurred, funded by an unknown third party? Or are they just bad at their jobs, but because [PLOT_REASON] there isn't anyone better to take their place?
94	某[秘密社团/盗贼/刺客公会]的成员通过定期宗教仪式中分发的祈祷材料接收秘密会面地点、任务/目标信息、违禁物品/物质或其他无法公开交换的有价值情报的编码指示。祭司/牧师是否参与其中？还是他们正被一只无形之手在不知不觉中操控？ Members of a [secret society/Thieves/Assassins guild] receive instructions encoded in prayer material that's distributed during regular religious services on where to meet in secret, information on missions/targets, illicit materials/substances, or other intel of value that cannot be exchanged in public. Are the priests/clerics in on it? Or are they being unknowingly manipulated by an unseen hand?
95	当地铁匠一夜之间失踪了，连他的家人也不知道他的去向。尽管当地人怀疑这与他获得的大量[稀有材料]有关——因为他根本不可能买得起。 The local blacksmith disappeared overnight. Not even his family has any clue about his whereabouts. Although the locals suspect it has something to do with the large quantity of [insert rare material] he acquired- because there's no way he could've afforded it.
96	一场批评君主制的海报宣传活动取得了超出某些上层人士舒适度的成功。这导致了突袭、逮捕以及本已过度劳累的夜巡队增加了巡逻。 A poster campaign critical of the monarchy has been rather more successful than is comfortable for some of the upper crust. This is leading to raids, arrests and increased patrols by the already overworked night watch.
97	一种诡异的黑色霉菌在城市中蔓延，在孤立的空间中突然出现。一群疯狂的德鲁伊教派是罪魁祸首，过去几周他们战略性地种植了这种真菌。该教派计划通过多次植物生长法术的仪式，将城市变成一片致命真菌的森林。 A strange black mold is spreading through the city, popping up in isolated spaces. A cult of mad druids are to blame, as over the last few weeks they've planted strategically placed cultures of the fungus. The cult intends to chain together several rituals of the Plant Growth spell to turn the city into a forest of deadly fungus.
98	一名恶作剧者开始在城中四处投射幻象。门、井盖等物品因此频繁被证实为幻影。城市守卫持续警惕着肇事者，值勤时常会戳戳碰碰他们怀疑的物体。 A prankster has started throwing illusions all over the city. Doors, manholes, and other such items are turning out to be illusory quite often as a result. The city watch is on constant guard for the perpetrator and will often poke and touch objects they're suspicious of while on duty.
99	一位当地年迈的牧师在一场特殊仪式中去世。聚集的人群惊愕地目睹一道璀璨光芒降临其躯体，随后爆发出无害却短暂致盲的闪光，尸体随之消失。更为神秘的是，现在少数市民的右颊上出现了隐形印记，每当他们接近或进入事发地点的神庙/圣地时，印记便会发光。皇家巫师要求正式调查，但城市卫队人手不足。 A local elderly priest died in the middle of a special ceremony. The gathered crowd is awestruck as a brilliant light descended on his body, exploding in a harmless but temporarily blinding flash, and the body was gone. Even more mysteriously, now a handful of citizens have an invisible mark on their right cheek that glows whenever they near or enter the temple/holy site where it happened. The Royal Wizard wants a formal investigation, but the city guard doesn't have the manning.
100	国王的妻子/女儿与城中臭名昭著的恶棍有染。此事将在[2d8]天内被揭露。 The King's wife/daughter is having an affair with a notorious villain in the city. It gets discovered in [2d8] days.
