1d100	道德模糊的任务
1	队伍受命追捕一群袭击定居点的野生动物。调查后发现，这是该地区/世界上该物种的最后一群。若玩家杀死它们，将导致可能维持生态系统所需的物种灭绝；但若放任其生存，则存在它们继续袭击定居点的风险。 The party is tasked to hunt down a pack of wild animals that has been attacking settlements. Upon investigating, it turns out this is the last of the specific animal species in the area/world. If the player's kill them, they are wiping out a species potentially needed for maintaining the Eco system, but letting them live runs the danger of them continuing to attack settlements.
2	一位死灵法师派遣他的亡灵到附近村庄掠夺物资，在这片贫瘠之地被指控盗墓。当队伍面对他时，发现他只是为了寻找并复活他早已逝去的家人——配偶、孩子和宠物。他只想再见他们一面。 A necromancer has been sending his undead to a nearby villages to raid supplies in an otherwise barren land and has been accused of grave robbing. When confronting the necromancer, the party finds out that he is only gathering supplies so he can find and restore his long dead family; spouse, children, pets. He only wants to see them one more time.
3	当地一个教派公开宣称在瀑布附近的空地上寻找新成员加入他们的精神联结与冥想。附近镇民觉得可疑并开始骚动，但这些教徒似乎并未做任何错事或施展魔法……除了公开承认他们是一个教派。 A local cult have become very vocal that they are looking for new members to join them in spiritual bonding and meditation in a clearing near a waterfall. The townsfolk nearby think it’s fishy and are getting riled up, but it doesn’t appear that these cultists are doing anything wrong or magical at all... except openly admitting that they’re in a cult.
4	队伍受雇从一片危险的沼泽中取回一种稀有且珍贵的药用植物，用于制作拯救垂死贵族的药剂。当他们找到这种植物时，却发现它是该物种的最后幸存者，拔除它会导致该物种灭绝。 The party is hired to retrieve a rare and valuable medicinal plant from a dangerous swamp which will be used to create a potion that can save a dying noble. When they find the plant, they discover that it is actually the last of its kind and uprooting it will force the plant's extinction.
5	一位本地牧师请求你阻止该地区一连串的盗墓行为，因为这可能惊扰亡魂甚至招致愤怒的幽灵。然而，盗墓者却是贫困的农民，他们声称需要尸体作为肥料，否则庄稼将歉收。 A local priest asks you to stop the string of grave-robberies in the area because they could disturb the souls or even create angry ghosts. The culprits, however, are destitute farmers who claim that they need the corpses as fertilizer or else their crops will fail.
6	一位军阀正在购买所有妓女和赌徒的契约，使他们脱离体面的服务生活。他们似乎正在将战争带入钢铁与火焰的新时代，但代价是森林和德鲁伊的毁灭。 A warlord is buying the contract of all the prostitutes and gambler from a life of respectable servitude. They seem to be bringing war into a new era of steel and fire, but, at the cost of the forest and druids.
7	一个贵族家族出重金雇佣某人绑架他们孩子绑架者的孩子，希望以此进行囚犯交换，而非满足绑架者的要求。 A noble family is paying a lot of gold for someone to kidnap the child of their child's kidnapper, in hopes they can do a prisoner trade instead of having to fulfil the kidnappers demands.
8	有一位强大的巫妖需要被阻止。与其他巫妖不同，它的灵魂与其后代绑定。对其家族树的调查显示，其大多数后代都是善良之人。只要有一人存活，巫妖就无法被真正击败。 There is a powerful lich that needs to be stopped. Unlike other liches its soul is bound to its descendants. Investigation into its family tree reveals that most of its descendants are good people. So, long as one survives the lich cannot be truly defeated.
9	一名前士兵接近玩家角色，请求他们帮助保护他免受昔日战友的愤怒。他在一场战斗中擅离职守，导致战友们阵亡。玩家必须决定是将其交给正义审判，还是帮助他逃离追捕者并保守他的秘密。 A former soldier approaches the player characters, asking for their help in protecting him from the wrath of his former comrades. He deserted his post during a battle, leaving his fellow soldiers to die. The players must decide whether to turn him in to face justice or to help him flee from his pursuers and keep his secret safe.
10	"你受雇于一个“神圣”组织，去追捕并杀害一个小家庭，因为他们相信其坟墓预示这家人会对其事业构成某种威胁。这家人对预言或该组织一无所知，他们像其他普通百姓一样生活。 You are hired by a ""holy"" organization to hunt down and kill a small family as they believe their tombs foresee this family to be some kind of threat to their cause. The family does not know about the prophecy or who this organization is, they live their lives like every other commoner."
11	一位贵族出身的强盗首领被关在地牢中，即将因杀害国王的表亲而受审。首领的妻子有两位受人尊敬的僧侣目击了死亡过程，能够证明首领的无辜。她希望你能安全地将他们带到法庭，以洗清他的罪名；而强盗的二把手，对新获得的领导地位感到满意，将会阻挠你。问题是，这位首领曾杀害了许多平民，这些罪行他将永远不会受到审判；这次审判可能是其他受害者获得正义的唯一机会。 A noble-turned-bandit chief is in the dungeon, soon to be tried for killing a cousin of the king. The chieftain's wife has two respectable monks who witnessed the death and can testify to the chieftain's innocence. She wants you to get them safely to the court to clear his name; the bandits' second-in-command, happy with his new position over the bandits, will be opposing you. The problem is, the chieftain has murdered many commoners, murders he will never face justice for; this trial may the only semblance of justice his other victims ever get.
12	红落领主的一件传家宝被盗，很快发现罪魁祸首是一群哥布林。然而，追踪到哥布林后，发现这件所谓的传家宝其实是从附近一座古墓中偷来的，墓中不安的亡灵一直在恐吓哥布林村庄，直到他们找到戒指。但很快发现，归还戒指可能会增强那些黑暗灵魂的力量，而非平息它们。 The Lord of Redfallow has been robbed of a family heirloom, it is quickly made clear that the culprits are band of goblins. Upon tracking down the goblins though, it is revealed that this supposed family heirloom was stolen from a nearby tomb, and the disturbed spirits within have been terrorizing the Goblins village until they find the ring. However, it's soon discovered that returning the ring may empower those dark spirits rather than silencing them.
13	一位新当选的镇议会领袖要求当地农民不得将作物卖给邻近城市。议员声称善良的农民一直遭受低薪之苦，而城市领主因近期瘟疫导致许多市民无法工作，未向市民征税。走投无路之下，他雇佣了队伍，要么说服议员了解粮食的迫切需求，要么悄无声息地除掉他，以便领主的使者能协商出领主实际能负担的支付方案。 A newly chosen leader of a town's council is demanding the farmers there to not sell their crops to a nearby city. The councilman claims the good farmers have been underpaid for their labors, while the lord of the city has not claimed taxes from his citizens as a recent plague has left many unable to work. At his wit's end, he offers to hire the party to either convince the councilman of the dire need for food, or quietly get rid of him so the lord's men may negotiate payment the lord can actually afford.
14	大祭司病重。她禁止派遣远征队寻找药物，认为这是拒绝神明为她准备的死亡礼物。她的追随者因恐惧失去她的指引与保护，希望你能秘密寻找药物给她服用。 The High Priestess is gravely ill. She has forbidden an expedition to try to find medicine for her; it would be, she says, refusing the gift of death the gods have prepared for her. Her followers, terrified of going on without her guidance and protection, want you to go find medicine that they can give her in secret.
15	在一片长子继承制严格实行的土地上，一位领主寻求专业协助，以除掉他愚蠢且恶毒的长子，为更胜任且理智的幼子铺平道路。 In a land where inheritance is strictly to the eldest child, a lord seeks professional assistance to terminate his stupid and vicious eldest son to clear the way for a more competent and reasonable younger sibling.
16	玩家角色受命调查一个与世界隔绝多年的小村庄。抵达后，他们发现村庄由一位强大而神秘的女巫统治，她承诺保护村民免受伤害，以换取他们的忠诚与服从。玩家必须决定是推翻女巫解放村民，还是与她合作揭开村庄隐藏的黑暗秘密。 The player characters are tasked with investigating a small village that has been cut off from the rest of the world for many years. Upon arriving, they find that the village is ruled by a powerful and mysterious sorceress who has promised to keep the villagers safe from harm in exchange for their loyalty and obedience. The players must decide whether to overthrow the sorceress and free the villagers, or to try to work with her to uncover the dark secrets that the village is hiding.

The party has been tasked to end the child's life to prevent the town from falling any further into debt to its neighbors and loan sharks.
21	队伍受命保护两国和平峰会，其中一方明显强势。和平协议对强势方极为有利。队伍很快发现弱势方的自由战士/恐怖分子策划破坏峰会并刺杀强势方重要人物。保护峰会意味着弱势方将被迫接受不利协议，但放任或协助刺杀可能导致其被彻底征服。 The party is tasked with defending a peace summit between two nations, one much stronger than the other. The peace deal is clearly lopsided to the stronger side. The party soon discovers a plot to disrupt the peace summit and assassinate an important figure on the stronger side by freedom fighters/terrorists on the weaker side. Protecting the summit will mean the weak nation will be stuck with a bad deal, but letting the assassination go through (or assisting it) may mean it will be conquered entirely.
22	"你受地方当局之命去推翻一位海盗女王，但随着队伍深入调查，很快发现她的组织内部存在权力斗争，许多人对她“仁慈”的法规（在我的游戏中是禁止奴隶贸易，但你可以选择更温和的内容）感到不满。将她赶下台将迎来一位更为危险、道德底线更低的新海盗领主。 You are tasked with bringing down a pirate queen by local authorities, but as your party investigates, it soon becomes clear that there is a power struggle in her organization, with many chaffing against the ""benevolent"" codes of the Pirate Queen (in my game it was banning slave traders but you might want something lighter). Removing her from power will bring in a new pirate lord that is far more dangerous and has far fewer scruples."
23	一个小村庄被一场神秘诅咒困扰，导致庄稼枯萎、动物生病。玩家被请求调查诅咒原因并解除它。然而，随着深入调查，他们发现诅咒是村民自己施加的，作为抵御更大邪恶的最后手段。玩家必须决定是解除诅咒并冒险释放邪恶，还是让村庄自生自灭。 A small village has been plagued by a mysterious curse that causes crops to wither and animals to sicken. The players are asked to investigate the cause of the curse and remove it. However, as they delve deeper, they discover that the curse was placed by the villagers themselves, as a last resort to protect themselves from an even greater evil. The players must decide whether to lift the curse and risk unleashing the evil, or to leave the village to its fate.

The demonic force is a very young child who lost their parents and made a pact with a fiend/devil to play with the child and keep them company forevermore.
25	"当地权力机构——一座教堂的刽子手请求你营救被一伙“强盗”绑架的孩子，这些强盗试图阻止他们领袖的处决。实际上，这群强盗是自由战士，正努力阻止冷酷腐败的教会，该教会正以未必明显造福普通人的方式杀害任何敢于质疑其权威的人。 An executioner for the local power, a church, has asked you to rescue their child who has been kidnapped by a group of ""bandits"" attempting to stop the execution of their leader.

26	一群木精灵雇佣队伍破坏一家污染当地河流并杀害野生动物的工厂。侏儒工厂主声称污染是意外，他们正在努力解决问题，但精灵坚称工厂主在撒谎，工厂必须被摧毁。队伍必须决定是相信精灵还是工厂主，以及是对工厂采取行动还是寻求和平解决方案。 A group of wood elves hires the party to sabotage a factory that is polluting the local river and killing the wildlife. The gnome factory owner claims that the pollution is an accident and that they are working to fix the problem, but the elves insist that the owner is lying and that the factory must be destroyed.

27	一位当地领主请求队伍帮助追踪一只怪物，该怪物昨晚杀死了他的一些守卫并摧毁了林中的一间小屋，导致屋内所有人丧生。怪物正逃往山中，他们必须迅速行动。在追踪怪物的过程中，他们得知这怪物是[被召唤/被带来/被创造]来作为领主生日盛大狩猎的目标。然而，怪物过于强大无法控制，现在正试图返回家园。所有与怪物相关的死亡都是领主试图阻止并重新捕获它的结果。 A local lord enlists the help of the party to track down a monster that has slain some of his guards and destroyed a small cottage in the woods last night, killing all inside. It his escaping into the mountains, and they must hurry. As they follow the trail of the creature, they learn that the creature was [Summoned / Brought Here / Created] to be the focus of a great hunt the lord wanted to hold for their birthday. The creature proved too powerful to contain, and it is trying to head home, now. All deaths related to it are a result of the lord's efforts to stop and recapture the creature.
28	队伍受雇调查并阻止附近村庄发生的一系列血腥谋杀。他们最终发现这些谋杀是由一个寻求报复村民的生物造成的。村民们曾因庄稼歉收而绝望地举行了一场魔法仪式，但由于对魔法知之甚少，仪式惨遭失败，导致一名村民被腐化，随后他们因羞耻和厌恶将其驱逐出村。村民们对此感到羞愧，不愿解释真相。而怪物则不惜一切代价寻求正义。 The party is hired to investigate and prevent a series of horrible and bloody murders in a nearby village. They eventually discover that the murders are caused by a creature who is seeking revenge against the villagers. The villagers had conducted a desperate magical ritual in hopes to bless their failing crops, but with little knowledge of magic, it failed horribly, corrupting one of the villagers, whom they then ran out of town in shame and disgust. The villagers are ashamed and resistant to explaining the truth. The monster just wants justice, at any cost.
29	玩家角色受一位富商雇佣，调查其偏僻乡间庄园的怪事。抵达后，他们发现庄园被商人祖先的复仇之灵所困扰，这些祖先因财富与权力被谋杀。玩家必须决定是帮助安抚亡灵，还是试图利用其力量为己谋利。 The player characters are hired by a wealthy merchant to investigate strange happenings at his isolated country estate. Upon arriving, they discover that the mansion is haunted by the vengeful spirits of the merchant's ancestors, who were murdered for their wealth and power. The players must decide whether to help lay the spirits to rest, or to try to use their powers for their own gain.
30	队伍受命追捕一名刺客，该刺客目前在城中犯下多起骇人听闻的谋杀案，每次作案后都将尸体公开展示。实际上，刺客正在系统性地瓦解一家大型商人组织，该组织曾因拒绝出售家族企业而使其家族破产并最终毁灭，之后在地区内的每份合同中都对其进行打压和排挤。 The party is tasked to hunt down an assassin who is currently responsible for a considerable number of gruesome murders in the city, with the bodies being left on display after each killing. The assassin is actually systematically dismantling the large merchant organization who was responsible for the bankruptcy and subsequent ruination of her family when they refused to sell their family business to the organization and were undercut and outbid on every following contract in the region.
31	一位当地矮人矿主请求队伍调查工人中一种危险药物的传播情况。该矿具有重要战略意义，因为它是王国防御所必需的魔法晶石的丰富来源。在调查过程中，冒险者们了解到矿工们使用药物只是为了缓解因不堪忍受的工作条件带来的身心痛苦。药物由居住在矿井更深处的狗头人自行酿造提供。作为交换，狗头人希望留在那里自行开采晶石，就像矮人拥有矿井之前那样。 A local dwarven mine owner asks the party to investigate the spread of a dangerous drug amongst the workers. The mine has great strategic importance because it is a rich source of magic crystals vital for the kingdom's protection. During the investigation, the adventurers learn that mine workers only use the drug to dull their physical and emotional pain because the working conditions are unbearable. The drug is provided by kobolds living in the deeper parts of the mine who brew it themselves. In exchange for the drug, the kobolds want to stay there and mine crystals themselves, as they did before there was a dwarven-owned mine.
32	一位富商雇佣队伍从一群强盗手中夺回一件珍贵稀有的魔法物品，强盗声称商人并非物品的真正主人，而是先偷走了它，他们只是试图夺回本属于自己的东西。队伍必须决定相信谁，以及将物品归还给商人还是强盗。 A wealthy merchant hires the party to retrieve a valuable and rare magical artifact from a group of bandits who stole it from them.

But she is busy fighting an outbreak of disease at home, and patients will likely die if she leaves. Then again, the death of the prince would throw the succession into chaos and possibly bring a civil war.

36	队伍遇到一支被圣骑士和骑士袭击的武装商队。商队即将被击败，最后几名守卫正保护着一个小孩。队伍介入并救下了孩子，在最后一名守卫临终前，被请求将孩子带到“幸福时光神殿”。途中可能会遭遇更多抵抗，更多圣骑士和冠军声称孩子是邪恶的，将毁灭一切。队伍将孩子送到神殿，获得奖励，一切看似顺利。直到地狱之门大开，因为孩子正是神殿试图释放的末日拼图的最后一块。 The party comes across an armed caravan being attacked by paladins and knights. They are in the process of being defeated, and the last few defenders are guarding a young child. The party intervenes and saves the child, and on the deathbed of the last defender, are asked to bring them to the Temple of Happy Times. The party may face more resistance along the way, with more paladins and champions claiming that the child is evil and will destroy us all. They get the child to the temple, are rewarded, and all seems well. Until hell breaks loose because they were the last piece of some doomsday puzzle the Temple was trying to release.
37	队伍受雇保护一支运送药品的商队，这些药品是为远方一座城堡中感染瘟疫的平民准备的。另一个同样遥远的城镇听闻此事，试图劫掠商队以获取药品，用于他们自己同样受感染的民众。药品不足，时间也不够，无法同时送达两地。 The party is hired to protect a caravan that contains medicine for a far away castle filled with plague infected commoners.

There is not enough medicine nor time to get to both places.
38	当地领主希望队伍帮助击败一群正在其领地外集结的恶徒。有确凿证据表明，这群人将在未来几周内试图吞并领主的部分土地。当队伍调查时，他们发现这些恶徒实际上是该地区的流亡者，正试图夺回自己的家园。这些流亡者曾是残暴的统治者，而现任领主也好不到哪里去。 The local lord would like the party's help defeating a band of villains that are gathering just outside his territory. There is strong evidence that the band will attempt to annex part of the Lord's land in the coming weeks.

41	一场饥荒肆虐附近乡村。一支商队载着食物前往受灾地区售卖。队伍经过时，商队发生意外，货物散落一地。饥饿的村民涌向食物开始哄抢。队伍是视而不见，但可能让商人破产，还是忍心驱赶那些或许最终能得到食物的可怜饥民？ A famine has plagued the nearby countryside. A caravan of merchants carry food to sell to the stricken region. An accident occurs and the caravan wrecks as the party passes by. Starving villagers descend on the food and begin stealing it. Do they party turn a blind eye but potentially bankrupt the merchants or can they stomach beating back the poor starving villagers who may get the food anyway?
42	一群矮人雇佣队伍去夺回被巨魔抢走的珍贵宝石。巨魔正在用这颗宝石为一件对他们具有重大宗教意义的魔法神器提供能量。巨魔声称这颗宝石是古代遗物，理应属于他们，而矮人无权拥有。 A group of dwarves hires the party to retrieve a valuable gemstone that has been taken by a group of trolls. The trolls are using the gemstone to power a magical artifact that holds great religious significance to them. The trolls claim that the gemstone is an ancient artifact that rightfully belongs to them, and that the dwarves have no right to it.
43	一群有权有势的走私者找到队伍，请求帮助他们将一批非法且珍稀的动物运过边境。许多动物濒临灭绝。他们声称这些动物将被送往一家著名动物园，在那里得到良好照料并鼓励繁殖。但当地的德鲁伊教团希望将它们全部放归自然栖息地。 The party is approached by a group of influential and powerful smugglers who ask for their help in transporting a shipment of illegal and exotic animals across the border.

46	据报告，定居点墓地中的死者不安分。调查发现一群死灵法师正试图复活他们挚爱的亲人，但他们的法术也在唤醒其他死者。玩家们是阻止死灵法师，剥夺他们再见亲人的愿望，还是允许他们继续，冒着不死生物泛滥的风险，阻止定居点居民祭拜逝者？ Reports have indicates restless dead at the settlement's cemetery. Investigation reveals a group of necromancers are attempting to raise their own loved ones, but their magics are also raising other dead. Do the players stop the necromancers and deny them their wish of seeing their loved ones again, or do they allow them to continue and risk an undead infestation stopping the settlement's people from visiting their dead?
47	一个侏儒社会正试图筑坝拦截瀑布和河流，为村庄发电，但一个讨厌的霍比特人德鲁伊不断破坏他们的进展或在夜间袭击工地。他们希望除掉这个怪物以完成水坝。调查后，德鲁伊会警告队伍，阻塞河流将导致附近洞穴网络洪水泛滥。虽然被驱赶的动物可能有害，但他更关心的是他在洞穴深处施法沉睡的绿龙。若洞穴被淹，龙将苏醒，给该地区带来侏儒们已遗忘的毁灭。 A gnome society is attempting to dam up a water fall and river to generate power for their village, however a pesky Hobgoblin Druid keeps destroying their progress or attacking their work site at night. They want the monster removed so they can finish the damn. Upon investigation, the Druid will warn the party that backing up the river will cause flooding of the nearby cave network. Although the animals this will displace could be harmful, he is more concerned with the enchanted sleeping green dragon he has enchanted deep within the cave network. Should the caves flood, he will be awakened, and will bring destruction upon the region in a way the Gnomes have forgotten.
48	当地帮派一直在销售未经政府授权且未按规定征税的私酒。一名政府官员私下雇佣了队伍，要求他们潜入并下毒，以此消灭买家并铲除非法生意。 A local gang has been selling illicit alcohol that has not been authorized and properly taxed by the governing authorities. The party is hired by a government official off-books, to sneak into and poison the product, thereby eliminating the buyers and the illicit business.
49	一位法师正在用魔法药剂感染村庄的水源，所有饮用者都会被其魅惑。主要效果是迫使饮用者服从法师的指令。法师实际上是善意的，担任村庄的执政官，解决纠纷、提供建议和命令。村庄运转顺畅，但无人拥有自由意志。村庄中屠夫的儿子因在森林中迷路几天未饮水，现已得知真相。他雇佣队伍去杀死法师。队伍还发现了村庄的黑暗历史，以及多年来的战争、暴力和血腥游戏，这些在法师到来后已成为过去。 A mage is infecting a village’s water supply with a magic potion that charms everyone that drinks it. The main effect is that it forces all that drink it to obey the mage’s instructions. The mage is actually benevolent, and acts as the village's prefect, resolving disputes, giving advice and orders. The village runs smoothly, but no one has any free will. The son of the butcher in the village had stopped drinking the water as he got lost in the woods for a few days and now knows what's going on. He hires the party to kill the mage. The party also finds out the sordid history of the village and its many years of warring, violence, and blood games that are now a thing of the past since the mage arrived.
50	一位极其年老的龙裔希望队伍从强盗手中夺回他家族的银矿。这些强盗并未偷窃任何东西，但据传他们抓了俘虏。整个城镇都紧张不安，几乎要派出一群愤怒的暴民！结果发现传言部分属实，但这些强盗自认为是赏金猎人，最近抓获了一群邪教徒。 An incredibly old Dragonborn wants the party to reclaim his families Silver Mine from bandits. These bandits haven’t stolen anything, but are rumoured to have captured prisoners. The whole town is nervous and is on the brink of sending in an angry mob! Turns out the rumours are somewhat true, but the bandits see themselves as bounty hunters and recently caught a group of cultists.
51	在法师进行仪式时保卫他的塔楼。镇民们愤怒不已，因为（战斗进行到一半时，队伍才意识到）法师绑架了一个孩子用于血祭。 Defend a wizard's tower while he's casting a ritual. The town's folk are up in arms because (half-way through the battle the party realizes) the wizard kidnapped a child for blood sacrifice.
52	队伍受雇营救被邪恶教派绑架的年轻贵族，结果发现教派的邪恶程度被夸大了，而这位年轻人真心实意地投身其中。 The party is hired to rescue a young nobleman kidnapped by an evil cult. It turns out that the cult's evilness is somewhat exaggerated, and the young man is sincerely committed to it.

54	一位强大的存在正逼近城市，所到之处皆带来死亡与毁灭。有一件神器能永久消灭此存在，但神器本身邪恶，会腐蚀使用者。 A powerful being is approaching the city. It causes death and destruction where ever it goes. There is an artifact, that can permanently kill this being. However the artifact itself is evil and corrupts whoever uses it.
55	人们无缘无故地食物中毒。暗中，当地的巫师或炼金术士将人类尸体（或腐烂的动物尸体）魔法般地转化为优质牲畜肉。没有这些额外食物，城镇将面临饥荒；但继续食用，人们会持续生病。 People have been getting food poisoning without any apparent reason. In secrecy, the local wizard or alchemist has been magically changing the corpses of humans (or rotten dead animals) into prime livestock meat. The town will starve without the extra food, but will continue to fall ill with it.
56	一群暴民聚集起来要绞死一名被指控谋杀的人。被告坚称自己无罪，且未接受审判。群众提供的证据并不确凿：比如有人在谋杀前看到他靠近房子，或有人在他家发现带血的衣服，而前一天他刚宰过猪。队伍是袖手旁观，可能让无辜者丧命，还是冒着激怒整个定居点的风险，与他们战斗以解救他？ A lynch mob has gathered to hang someone accused of murder. The accused proclaims their innocence and the fact they have not received a trial. The evidence given by the crowd is not concrete: things like people seeing him near the house before the murder or someone finding bloody clothes in his house when he had been slaughtering pigs the day before. Does the party stand by and potentially let an innocent man die, or do they risk drawing the ire of the settlement by fighting them to free him?
57	玩家角色被一位富有的贵族请求寻找其失踪的儿子，最后见到他是在附近一片危险的森林中。随着调查深入，他们发现贵族的儿子可能参与了一个向强大恶魔献祭儿童的黑暗邪教。玩家必须决定是将儿子交给当局，还是试图拯救他免受自身邪恶行为的后果。 The player characters are approached by a wealthy noble who asks them to track down his missing son, who was last seen in a nearby dangerous forest. As they delve deeper into the investigation, they discover that the noble's son may have been involved in a dark cult that sacrifices children to a powerful demon. The players must decide whether to turn the son over to the authorities, or to try to save him from his own evil actions.
58	玩家被一个上层享乐主义者俱乐部雇佣，寻找并杀死一只特定的眼魔以供食用。与此同时，另一个团体声称这是不道德的，因为眼魔是有感知的生物，应该通过活捉或杀死它来将其绳之以法。然而，当队伍找到眼魔时，他们发现它虽然不愿意被杀或被捕获，但比起浪费自己，它更愿意被吃掉。 The players are hired by an upper class Epicurean's Club to find and kill a specific beholder for them to eat. Meanwhile, a second group claims that this is immoral, since beholders are sentient beings, and to instead bring the beholder to justice by capturing it alive or killing it. However, when the party finds the beholder, they discover that it, while not willing to be killed or captured, much prefers being eaten to letting itself go to waste.
59	邪恶教派试图复活其神明以行恶事。骑士团致力于铲除该教派及其威胁。第三方雇佣人手阻止骑士团消灭教派，声称囚禁邪神的牢笼以信仰为能源，若足够多的（彻底邪恶的）教徒死亡，邪神将破笼而出，带来浩劫。 Evil cult is trying to bring their deity back so it can do its evil thing. An order of knights is working to eliminate this cult and the threat it poses. A third party hires some individuals to stop the order from eliminating the cult, claiming that the being which trapped the cultists god managed to power the cage with worship, if enough (thoroughly evil) cultists die then the god will break free and wreak havoc.
60	"队伍受雇驱赶一群“恐怖分子”，他们使用魔法唤醒树木并让植物生长以攻击附近城市。然而，这些“恐怖分子”实际上是德鲁伊，他们试图在被市长手下烧毁的森林原址重新造林以扩展城市。德鲁伊不认为自己的行为是恐怖主义，而是保护自然免受那些想要摧毁它并用文明取代之人的侵害。 The party is hired to drive off a group of ""terrorists"" using magic to awaken trees and grow plants to attack a nearby city. However, the ""terrorists"" are actually druids that seek to regrow the forest where the mayor's men burned it to the ground to expand their city. The druids do not see their acts as terrorism but as an attempt to protect nature from the ones that want it destroyed and replaced with civilization."
61	队伍受雇于外国政府或当前政府内部势力，潜入一场和平抗议并暗中煽动暴力。此举要么为政府派遣军队镇压当地民众提供正当理由，要么推动抗议演变为推翻腐败政权的革命。 The party is hired by a foreign government or entities within the current government to infiltrate a peaceful protest and surreptitiously turn the protest violent. This will either give the government the justification it needs to send in soldiers to suppress the locals, or it will propel the protest into a revolution to overthrow a corrupt regime.
62	队伍被要求调查为何进入森林的人都会失去记忆。一位遇到他们的精类生物从可怕怪物手中救下他们，但抹去了他们的记忆，以防他们泄露其家园的秘密。 The party is asked to investigate why anyone who enters the woods returns with no memories. A Fey creature who encounters them prevents their death from a terrifying creature, but wipes their memory so they cannot tell others about its home.
63	一座新城将在废弃数十年的老磨坊镇遗址上兴建。不幸的是，旧居民当年离奇死亡是有原因的，他们愿意从坟墓中爬起，守护那骇人的秘密。 A new city is going to be built on the sight of an old mill town that’s been abandoned for decades. Unfortunatly, the old inhabitants died off for a reason, and they are willing to rise from the grave to protect that terrifying secret.
64	一名邪恶的魔法师正在捕捉人们并吸取他们的生命能量。原来，这位法师为了获得更多力量召唤了一个强大的存在。法师很快意识到自己无法控制这个存在，于是将其困在了一个魔法监狱中。这个监狱需要生命能量来维持。阻止法师，可能释放出更可怕的东西，或者允许法师继续窃取人们的生命能量。 An evil magic user is capturing people and draining them of their life energy. It turns out that, in an attempt to gain more power the mage summoned a powerful entity. The mage quickly realized that they were unable to control this entity, so they trapped it in a magical prison. The prison requires life energy to maintain it. Stop the mage and potentially release something far worse or allow the mage to keep stealing people's life energy.
65	一个狩猎公会难以获取食物，他们服务的城镇开始挨饿。更糟的是，两名猎人最近归来，伤势严重。队伍被请求调查狩猎场，试图找出动物们发生了什么。队伍最终发现，狩猎场最近受到了一位德鲁伊的保护，他的动物朋友数月前曾被一名猎人伤害。 A hunting guild is struggling to produce any food and the town they serve is beginning to starve. To top things off, two of the hunters returned recently, very badly injured. The party is asked to investigate the hunting grounds and try to figure out what has happened to the animals. The party eventually discover that the hunting grounds have recently come under the protection of a druid, who's animal friend had been injured by one of the hunters months prior.
66	一位面包师因售卖有毒食品被判死刑，但他有证据证明自己无辜。不幸的是，真正的下毒者权势滔天，难以触及。若面包师被处决，真凶将放松警惕，给当局提供抓捕城市头号通缉犯的唯一机会。是否应让无辜者死去以阻止连环杀手？ A baker is sentenced to death for selling poisoned goods. The man has proof he is innocent. Unfortunately, the real poisoner is a very powerful man, and especially hard to get to. If the baker is killed, his guard will be down, giving the authorities their only chance to apprehend their cities most notorious criminal. Should an innocent die to stop a serial killer?
67	一户人家寻找家中失踪的孩子，进一步调查发现孩子因父母的疏忽而离家出走。孩子声称遭受虐待或缺乏照顾。 A family seeks to find their missing child who is missing from their home, upon further discovery the child ran away from the home due to negligence on part of the parents. The child claims abuse or lack of provision.
68	队伍必须寻找一位著名医者来治疗土地/财富/公会的继承人。医者随行的一群仆人，长袍下隐藏着形状怪异的病变。为了治愈继承人，医者需使用一颗魔法球，痛苦地将疾病转移到仆人身上，球中漂浮的病变形状会如实地出现在仆人身上。 The party must seek out a famed healer to treat the heir to the land/fortune/guild. The healer travels with a group of servants with oddly shaped lesions hidden beneath their robes. In order for the healer to cure the heir they must use a magic orb that painfully transfers the disease to their servants leaving fresh lesions in the same shape as those floating in the orb as the disease is transferred.
69	风米尔贤者藏有无数书籍，其中不乏孤本，他拒绝他人复制甚至阅览。尤兰修道院的僧侣认为这是对知识的不可容忍的限制，财产权无法为此辩护；他们希望你偷偷将书带出，待复制完成后再归还。 The Sage of Windmere hoards countless books, some of them one-of-a-kind, refusing to let others copy or even see them. The Monks of Yewlane consider this an intolerable restriction on knowledge that mere property rights cannot justify; they want you to sneak books away from him, then return them once copies are made.
70	一位领主派队伍去调查一片通常繁荣的森林村庄物资短缺的原因。村庄正在崩溃，因为他们从森林中采集的水果和蔬菜都已腐烂枯萎。原因是这片森林区域由一群过度慈善的树精控制，她们献出生命来供应食物，如今随着最后一位树精的逝去，森林也在消亡。 A Lord sends the party to investigate the lack of supplies coming from a usually thriving village in the woods. The Village is falling apart because the fruit and vegetables that they gather from the forests are rotten and shriveled. The reason for this is because the section of the forest is controlled by a group of overly charitable dryads that give their lives to supply the food and now the forest is dying with the last dryad.
71	哥布林一直在袭击村庄上方新建的水坝，队伍受雇阻止他们。哥布林声称水坝导致他们的地下家园被淹，队伍必须决定是优先保护村庄的安全，还是哥布林的家园。 Goblins have been attacking a newly constructed dam above a village, and the party is hired to stop them. The goblins claim that the dam has caused their underground homes to flood, and the party must decide whether to prioritize the safety of the village or the homes of the goblins.
72	一个山村正在宣传一口神奇的泉水，任何沐浴其中的人都能获得龙的力量！这个机会（尽管极其昂贵）太诱人，不容错过。但他们没有告诉大家的是，这“神奇泉水”实际上是一条远古巨龙的蓝色血液，它是其种族的最后幸存者。他们将它锁在它曾经称为家园的山中，并不断放血，几乎让它丧命。队伍会怎么做？与这些龙血强化的人战斗？还是让一个无辜善良的生物继续受苦？ An entire mountain village are advertising a magical wellspring that can grant any who bathe in it the power of a dragon! The opportunity (although incredibly expensive) is too good not to investigate. What they’re NOT telling everyone is that this ‘Magical Wellspring’ is actually the crystal blue blood of a dragon that is beyond ancient and the last of its kind. They have it chained up inside the mountain it used to call its home and have bled it to the point that it’s almost dead. What will the party do? Fight these dragon infused people? Or let an innocent, good hearted creature suffer?
73	一位重要外交官或权威人士寻求玩家角色帮助他假死。他渴望退休，摆脱职位压力，只想过上“普通”生活。然而，王国正与敌对国家举行重大和平会议，若他缺席，会议很可能偏离正轨。若他出席，他的工作将确保两国未来多年的和平。 An important diplomat or authority seeks the PCs to help him fake his death. Desperate to retire and be rid of the pressures of his position, he simply wants to live a “normal” life from now on. Unfortunately the kingdom is having a big peace meeting with a rival nation, that will likely go wayward without them. If he attended the meeting however, his work would be required to maintain peace with the other nation for years to come.
74	一位智者所写的一系列预言在过去几年大多成真。最后一个尚未应验的预言指出，若一个带有特定胎记的孩子在这个国家长大，将引发巨大灾难。这样一个孩子降生了。玩家们是要迫使一个可能无法负担或适应新生活的家庭背井离乡（可能面临其他国家不愿接纳的问题），还是说服他们留下，冒着预言成真的风险？ A collection of prophecies written by a sage have mostly come true the last few years. The last one which has yet to pass indicates that a child born with a certain birthmark will cause great calamity if they grow up in this country. A child with this mark is born. Do the players uproot an entire family who may not be able to afford or survive in a new land (potential issue of no other country wants to take them) or do they convince the people to stay and run the risk of the prophecy coming true?
75	一座城镇请求你帮助消灭一只据称杀害了他们一定数量居民的怪物。当你面对怪物时，它承认杀害了镇民，但那是由于夜间有人袭击了它的家园，怪物是出于自卫，并希望被独自留下。城镇想要利用怪物的庇护所进行扩张和商业开发，数月来一直试图恐吓或杀死它。城镇当前的基础设施已无法满足需求，且一直未能说服怪物离开。镇领导认为他们别无选择。 A town seeks your help in slaying a monster that has been reported to kill a certain number of theirs. When confronting the monster, it admits to killing the town folk, but as a result of an attack on their home at night. The monster was acting in self-defense and would prefer to be left alone. The town is wanting to use the monster's sanctuary as development for expansion and business and have been trying to scare or kill it away for months now. The town is outgrowing its current infrastructure and have been unable to get the monster to agree to leave. The town leaders believe they had no other choice.
76	队伍接到请求，要阻止一名盗墓制造亡灵的死灵法师。他们很快发现，死灵法师利用亡灵经营着一座大型农场，供养着周边多个村庄。 The party receives a request to stop a necromancer who is robbing graves to create undead. They soon learn that the necromancer is using the undead to run a large farm that supports several surrounding villages..
77	队伍受雇寻找一名困扰小镇的罪犯。队伍被松散地监视，并需定期汇报进展，以确保小镇物有所值。队伍追踪此人，却发现此人实为双魂一体，形态随之变换。体内无辜的灵魂对另一半的行为毫无记忆，且完全无害。若队伍无所作为，有罪的灵魂将继续恐吓小镇。 The party is hired to find a criminal that has been terrorizing the town. The party is monitored loosely and is expected to give updates on their progress to ensure that the town is getting their money's worth. The party tracks the individual but finds that the individual is actually two souls in one body, and transforms to reflect so. The innocent soul in the body has no recollection of what the other half is doing, and is completely harmless. If the party does nothing, the guilty soul will continue to terrorize the town.
78	一位海盗船长从国王那里偷走了一大笔宝藏。通过协助他们的海盗行为来赢得海盗的信任，从而找出他藏匿宝藏的地点。 A pirate captain has stolen a great treasure from the King. Gain the pirate's trust by aiding them in their piracy to find out where he's hidden the treasure.
79	自当地王国的皇室家族约十年前被处决以来，该地区因《三公爵协定》而维持着和平与和谐，这份条约使三个公国——如今的小王国——结为邦联，共同协作。这些小王国的人民因此受益匪浅。然而，关于一名男性继承人的未经证实的传闻始终不绝于耳：一个卷曲红发、深色皮肤、碧绿眼眸的婴儿，在出生当天，即家族覆灭之日，随皇家保姆逃脱。忠于旧王室的小规模但顽强的反抗势力一直潜伏在表面之下。你被召见与三位国王的代表会面。一名符合潜在失踪王室成员描述的十岁男孩在西北偏北100英里外的小镇被目击。找到他。在他的存在广为人知之前，悄无声息地除掉他。若你成功，将获得丰厚奖赏；若你失败，三个王国将陷入血腥战争。 Ever since the local kingdom's royal family was executed some 10 years ago, the area has existed in peace and harmony as a result of the Accord of the Three, a treaty amongst the three dukedoms, now minor kingdoms, to work together as a confederacy. The area economy has benefited incredibly for the people of these small kingdoms as a result. All the while, uncorroborated rumors abounded about a single male heir, a baby with curly red hair, dark complexion, and vivid green eyes, that escaped with the royal nursemaid on the day of his birth, the day of his family's death, persists. A small but strong rebellion loyal to the old royals has never been far below the surface. You are called to an audience with representatives of the three kings. A 10yr old boy matching the description of the potentially lost royal has been sighted 100 miles north by northwest in a small town. Find him. Kill him discretely before his existence becomes common knowledge. Upon your success, you will be rewarded handsomely, and, if you fail, the three kingdoms will devolve into bloody war.
80	一群村民雇佣队伍调查附近森林中的一系列怪事。村民认为森林被诅咒，他们正受到森林精灵的惩罚。队伍发现森林实际上被一群伐木工破坏，他们正在砍伐树木并污染水源。伐木工声称他们为邻近社区提供工作和资源。 A group of villagers hires the party to investigate a series of strange occurrences in a nearby forest. The villagers believe that the forest is cursed and that they are being punished by the spirits of the forest. The party discovers that the forest is actually being damaged by a group of loggers who are clear-cutting the trees and polluting the water. The loggers claim that they are providing jobs and resources for a neighboring community.
81	一位地方领主雇佣你清除占领教堂并开始侵占周边建筑的哥布林。到达后，你发现他们收留孤儿作为强制劳动力。孤儿们虽然痛苦，但当被问及是愿意留在街头还是接受哥布林提供的食宿时，他们选择了教堂。你的选择是放任不管还是清除哥布林，因为后者会继续侵占村庄的其他部分。 A local lord has hired you to remove the goblins that have taken over the church and has started to take over the surrounding buildings. Upon arrival you see they take in orphans as forced labor. The orphans are miserable but asking whether they prefer staying in the streets versus the meals and boarding the goblins provide, they choose the church. The choice is whether you leave them be or remove the goblins, because they will continue to take over the rest of the village.
82	队伍受当地神职人员委托，为三名孤儿兄弟姐妹寻找归宿：两个男孩（约12岁和10岁）和一个女孩（约6岁）。一位本地农民及其配偶只愿收养男孩（在农场干活）；一位探亲的富有无子寡妇只愿收养女孩（她想要继承人）。孩子们希望在一起。镇上无人能负担起收养三个孩子。寡妇将在两天后探亲结束时带女孩回她居住的地方。孩子们是在路上流浪时被发现的，无亲无故，也无本地关系。队伍会协商这些安排吗？说服其中一方收养所有三个孩子？捐赠给一个愿意收养三个孩子的完全不同的家庭？将孩子们带到另一个城镇，寄望于更好的结果？还是让神职人员处理此事？ The party is tasked by local clergy with finding homes for three orphaned siblings: two boys (about 12 and 10) and a girl (about 6). A local farmer and his spouse are willing to take only the boys (to work on the farm); a wealthy, childless widow visiting her cousin will take only the girl (she wants an heir). The children want to stay together. No one in town can afford to take all three children. The widow will take the girl back to the place where she lives in two days when her visit ends. The children, who were found wandering the road, have no living relatives and no local ties. Will the party negotiate these arrangements? Talk one of these parties into taking all three? Donate to a completely different family who will keep the children together? Take the children to another town and hope for the best? Leave the clergy to handle it?
83	"王位继承人并非正统；将证据送至王宫，以支持其兄长取代垂死的国王。兄长一直被视为私生子，但我们有一枚婚戒和神父的证词，证明国王在其出生前秘密与其母成婚。更甚者，年轻的“王位继承人”一直知晓此事，明白其兄长理应继承王位。问题是……这位兄长是个蠢材；虽为法定继承人，却可能成为一位糟糕的国王。 The heir apparent is not the rightful heir; get this evidence to the palace on behalf of his older brother, who should replace the dying King. The older brother has been considered illegitimate, but we have a wedding ring and testimony from the priest who secretly married the king to his mother before he was born. What's more, the younger ""heir apparent"" has known about this all along and knows that his older brother deserves the throne. Problem is... the older brother is an idiot; the rightful heir according to the law, but probably a terrible king-to-be."
84	队伍受雇清除附近森林中的一对致命枭熊，以便猎人能安心在森林中游荡。在前往猎杀野兽的路上，他们发现许多豺狼人尸体及与之战斗的痕迹。若选择调查，他们将在森林深处发现一群害怕枭熊的豺狼人，枭熊的存在阻止了它们深入森林（从而发现村庄）。若枭熊被除掉，豺狼人很可能会深入森林并发现村庄。 The party is hired to clear the nearby forest of a small pair of deadly owl bears so that the hunters may roam the forest in peace. On their way to slay the beasts, they find many signs and instances of Gnoll corpses and signs of fighting against them. If they chose to investigate, they will find on the far side of the forest is a band of Gnolls who fear the owl bears, and have been kept from exploring deeper in the woods (and thus discovering the village) because the Owl bears keep them at bay. Should they be removed, it is likely the Gnolls will push deeper into the forest and find the village.
85	玩家角色受雇清除附近矿洞中的狗头人，以便人类开采银矿。 PCs are hired to clear out kobolds from their mine nearby, so that humans can mine their silver.
86	队伍受雇将一箱珍贵药品送往一座远方城市，那里正遭受一种使人衰弱的消耗性疾病。你们被告知途中会遇到阻碍，可能需要走私进城，若被发现将被没收。对方急切地找到你们，并慷慨支付了报酬。然而，这并非药品，全是成瘾性毒品。 The party is hired to bring a crate of valuable medicine to a faraway city facing a debilitating wasting disease. You are warned that you will face opposition on your way, and may have to smuggle it in, and that it would be confiscated if found. Your party is approached with urgency and paid handsomely. However it's not medicine, it's all addictive narcotics.
87	队伍被雇佣为保镖，护送一名谈判代表前往两个交战城邦之间的和平会议。旅途中，他们与谈判代表相处越久，越发现他其实是一名前军阀，被指控犯有战争罪和对战俘进行残酷实验。据称他曾多次被箭、弩箭、几支弩炮箭射中，被刺伤、绞死、斩首并处以火刑。然而，其尸体从未被可靠地确认过身份。 The party has been hired as bodyguards, to escort a negotiator to a peace conference between two warring city states. During the journey, the more time they spend with the negotiator, they learn that he’s actually a former warlord, accused of war crimes and cruel experiments against enemy prisoners of war. He was supposedly shot several times with arrows, crossbow bolts, a couple of ballista bolts, stabbed, hanged, decapitated and burned at the stake. However, the body was never reliably identified.
88	队伍被要求消灭城外的一群狗头人/地精，因为它们偷窃当地农民的财物。然而，这群生物之所以偷窃，是因为它们被城镇赶出了家园。 The party is asked to eradicate a kobold/goblin pack outside the town for stealing from local farmers. The pack is only stealing because they've been pushed out of their home by the town.
89	一个魔鬼承诺实现一个愿望，以换取他从魔法镣铐中解脱。 A devil promises one wish in exchange for his release from magical shackles.
90	一位城镇领主希望你保护一项大型公共工程的建设。他们计划将河流改道至另一山谷，这将为其人民带来更加肥沃的土地。然而，原河流所在的山谷中有一个小村庄。若河流改道，该村将沦为鬼城。 A town lord wants you to protect the construction of a large public works. They are rerouting a river through a different valley which would mean far more fertile land for his people. However, the valley the river is being diverted from is occupied by a smaller village. Without the river, it will turn into a ghost town.
91	国王有一片未开化的边境叛乱地区，始终需要清除类人生物。最近有传言称，一个邪恶的巨眼怪/巨龙/巨型怪物正在集结巨人部落，他们统治着该地区，不仅限制了类人生物，也限制了人类定居者。当你见到那个部落的首领时，发现他聪明且几乎对所有提议都持开放态度。然而，他正在不断集结更多部落，很快将拥有更强大的力量。如果玩家除掉首领，巨人不会消失，可能会有更糟糕的领袖取而代之。如果玩家消灭巨人，类人生物将卷土重来，成为更大的麻烦。 The king has a rebel untamed frontier region that is always in need of purging of humanoids. Recently there is talk of an Evil Beholder/Dragon/Big Monster amassing a tribe of giants and that they rule that region limiting humanoids but also human settlers. Once you meet the leader of that tribe you find him to be intelligent and amendable to almost every propositions. However he is amassing tribes after tribes under his banner and will soon have much more power. If the players get rid of the leader, the giants will not go away and a worst leader may take his place. If the players wipe the giants, the humanoids will bounce back and be even more of a problem.
92	玩家角色遇到一位最近在一次失败的抢劫中受伤的臭名昭著的强盗。强盗提出一个交易：如果他们帮助他从附近的废墟中取回一件珍贵的文物，他将给予他们一大笔黄金，并提供可能引导他们找到更大宝藏的信息。然而，废墟被强大的魔法守护，而文物可能附有可怕的诅咒。 The player characters come across a notorious bandit who has recently been injured in a robbery gone wrong. The bandit offers them a deal: if they help him retrieve a valuable artifact from a nearby ruin, he will give them a large sum of gold and information that could lead them to even greater treasures. However, the ruin is guarded by powerful magic and the artifact may have a terrible curse attached to it.
93	"残忍的邪教徒绑架了男爵的儿子和儿媳，并威胁要杀害他们。男爵希望你救出他的儿子，但不要救他的儿媳，她必须“意外”被留下。一旦他的儿子成为鳏夫，男爵已为他安排了一桩极具政治优势的新婚姻。 Ruthless cultists have kidnapped the baron's son and daughter-in-law and promise to kill them. The baron wants you to rescue his son but not his daughter-in-law, who must be ""accidentally"" left behind. Once his son is widowed, the baron has a new highly favorable political marriage lined up for his son."
94	一位本地木匠请求你从附近的小树林中取回一种特殊木材。当你到达树林并试图砍伐其中一棵树时，一位树精现身。树精提出交易，若你同意将一株幼苗带到另一处地点种植（她可能会描述特定地点，例如：靠近海岸线），便可带走一棵树。 A local woodworker asks you to retrieve a special kind of wood from a grove nearby. When you reach the grove and attempt to fell one of the trees a dryad appears. The dryad will ask for a trade, you may take a tree from the grove if you agree to take a sapling to plant in another location (she may describe a particular kind of location eg: near the shoreline).
95	一名盗贼不断偷窃一位农民，若持续下去，农场将无法为当地城镇提供食物。社区中一位显赫人物，盗贼公会分会的恶毒头目，因该罪行被捕并受审。然而，他坚称自己无辜，从未用其技能伤害镇民。真相是，一群贫困的孩子们才是盗贼，他们这样做是因为单亲母亲病重，无法工作养家。没有食物，他们和母亲必将饿死。但若不将他们绳之以法，一个无辜之人将因未犯之罪失去双手。 A thief keeps stealing from a farmer and his farm is in danger of being unable to provide food for the local town if it continues. A prominent member of the community, the nasty head of the thieves guild chapter, has been arrested and charged for the crime. However: he is adamant on he is innocent and has never used their skills to harm the residents of the town. It turns out, a group of destitute children are the thieves, but they are doing so as their single mother is extremely ill and is unable to work to provide for the family. Without food, they and their mother will surely starve. However, an innocent man will soon lose his hands for a crime he did not commit if they are not brought to justice.
96	一个农业社区讲述着一只野兽一直在杀害他们的牲畜。实际上，这只野兽是一个被女巫诅咒的野人，夜晚会变成狂暴的狼。女巫诅咒他是因为他拒绝了她的爱，转而爱上了另一个人。 A farming community tell of a beast that has been killing their live stock. The beast is in fact a wild man, cursed by a witch to become a rampaging wolf at night. The witch cursed the man because he rebuked her love for the love of another.
97	玩家被一位巫师雇佣以提供保护。最近，这位巫师一直遭到来自异界的魔鬼/恶魔/扭曲生物的追杀。然而，真相是这些生物曾是活生生的人——巫师的前学徒们，他们回来复仇了。 Players get hired by a Wizard for protection. As of late, the Wizard has been hunted by devils/demons/twisted creatures of some sort from another plane. Turns out though, these creatures used to be living people- the Wizards former apprentices, who are coming back for revenge.
98	"队伍受雇解放一个刚被入侵的边境村庄。进一步调查发现，这远非该村庄首次被“解放”，多个群体都声称这里是他们的家园。 The party is hired to liberate a recently invaded border village. On further investigation, this is far from the first time the village has been ""liberated"", and multiple groups have a claim to it as their home."
99	一位领主请求队伍铲除一群骚扰当地百姓的底层匪徒。这些匪徒自称 A lord has asked the party to dispatch some low-life bandits who are terrorizing the local people. The bandits call
