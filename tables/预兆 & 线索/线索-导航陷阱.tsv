1d10	线索-导航陷阱
1	这里的每第四级石阶都略微歪斜，要么下陷，要么稍显突出 Every fourth stone step here is slightly askew, dipping downward or a little proud
2	微弱而脆弱的风似乎从裂缝中渗出，带着陈旧而孤寂的气息 Faltering and fragile breeze seems to ooze through cracks, smelling stale & lonesome
3	灰尘呈半圆形涂抹，在带有狭窄圆形扶壁的墙前被抹平 Smeared in a semi-circle, dust smoothed in front of a wall with narrow round buttress
4	锁链的哗啦声，随后是金属的尖啸，随着一阵颤抖戛然而止 Rattle of chains, followed by a metallic whine that ceases with a shudder
5	粗糙箭头，用匕首尖刻出，后被划掉：指向你来的方向 Crude arrow, carved by Dagger-tip, then crossed-out: Points from whence you came
6	即使没有矮人感知，也能通过水滴声察觉到这里的斜坡。 Even those without Dwarfsense can detect a slope here, thanks to water trickling
7	看似普通的天花板被整齐的砌石线条打断 An otherwise nondescript ceiling is interrupted by straight courses of mortared stone
8	极其坚固，此处的门铰链已被精心加固 Extremely substantial, hinges on the doors here have been painstakingly reinforced
9	低垂的铁梯横档无力地悬挂在嵌入的梯子上，从它们的固定处脱落 Lower Iron Rungs hang listlessly from an embedded ladder, fallen out of their perches
10	被鹤嘴锄破坏，手大小的洞口暴露出充满锈蚀机关的空腔 Savaged by Mattock, hand-sized hole reveals a hollow brimming with rusty workings
