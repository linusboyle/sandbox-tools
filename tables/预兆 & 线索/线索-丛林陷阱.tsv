1d10	线索-丛林陷阱
1	大铲子痕迹的潮湿土堆，被树枝和灌木拙劣地掩盖 Large shovel-marked mound of damp earth, inexpertly hidden by branches/brush
2	树枝向下弯曲，似乎有点不自然 Branch arching downward, as if bent is a little out of place
3	成熟而刺鼻的气味让人皱鼻：附近有腐烂的肉 Ripe and pungent scents make noses wrinkle: Rotting meat nearby
4	此处地面厚厚地覆盖着落叶，有些形成了小丘和堆叠 Leaves thickly carpet the ground here, some forming small mounds and piles
5	杂乱堆叠的树枝，尺寸适合小树苗，每根都被粗糙地切断 Haphazard stacks of branches, sized for smaller saplings, each sliced off crudely
6	一段磨损的绳索，被割断并丢弃，躺在泥泞中 A frayed cubit of Rope, cut and cast aside, rests in mud
7	插入潮湿土壤中，由仍带绿色的木材粗略修剪而成的木桩 Driven into damp earth, roughly pruned wooden stakes from still-green wood
8	此处有挖掘痕迹，大石块移动后留下的压印 Signs of digging here, the impression remaining from where a large stone was moved
9	柔韧的藤蔓，部分树皮被剥开，与同类不同，缺少叶子 Supple vines, bark peeled back in places and bereft of leaves unlike their fellows
10	非自然砍伐的粗大原木上仍留有斧头误击的刻痕 Felled unnaturally, thick logs still bear notches from mis-timed Axe bites
