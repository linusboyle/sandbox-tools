"1d200"	"无害地城生物"
1	"阿赫内利德——刺穿者的小型近亲，形似闪亮的鹅卵石或矿物露头。仅对老鼠和小型蜥蜴构成威胁。 Achnelithid - A tiny cousin of the Piercer, resembles a shiny pebble or mineral outcrop. Dangerous only to mice and small lizards."
2	"闪亮虫 - 这种硬币大小的甲虫状土元素以矿物质为食，这些矿物质在其外壳上被压缩成微小宝石，在某些幽暗地域社区中被用作货币。 Glitterbug - This coin-sized beetle-like Earth elemental feeds on minerals that are compressed into tiny gems on it's shell - used as a currency in some Underdark communities."
3	"绒毛虫 - 在地球上最寒冷的地方，可以发现这种白色蓬松的毛毛虫，名为绒毛虫。它们被体温吸引，但拥有足够的智力和少量心灵能力，以避开可能反感它们存在的人。这些无害的蓬松生物通过缠绕在沉睡的冒险者身上，拯救了许多生命。 Fuzzworm - In the coldest places on the planet, the white, fluffy caterpiller known as the Fuzzworm can be found. Attracted to body heat but with enough intelligence and a small amount of psychic ability so as to avoid those that might resent their presence, these benign, fluffy creatures have saved many lives by wrapping themselves around sleeping adventurers."
4	"垃圾拟怪 - 经典拟怪的非捕食版本，伪装成没人想要的东西——生锈的武器、发霉的画作、破碎的箱子。它们仍常被意外互动，少有冒险者在攻击前停下来检查区别。 Trash Mimic - A non-predatory version of the classic Mimic, disguises itself as things nobody would want - rusty weapons, mouldy paintings, shattered chests. They still get interacted with surprisingly often and it's a rare adventurer that stops to check the difference before attacking."
5	"盒子小怪——一种小型长方形盒子状的黑色生物，拥有上千只小脚，移动时仿佛在轮子上滑行或漂浮。它会发出轻微的哔哔声和吱吱声。无人知晓它们如何繁殖或其功能为何，但它们确实存在于此。 Box Critter - A smallish rectangle box shaped black creature that has a thousand little feet so when it moves it seems as if it is on wheels or floating. It makes small beeps and squeaks. No one actually knows how they reproduce nor what their function is, yet here they are."
6	"蟾菇怪 - 它看起来像一株及膝高的蘑菇，菌盖可能是蓝色、红色、绿色、黄色或紫色，但斑点总是白色的，实际上它是一个半感知生物。栖居洞穴。当暴露于火焰或星光下时，它有时会从地下钻出并长出一双脚。否则，它会在孢子落地生根的地方度过一生。它有两条手臂，能够使用武器，但通常用拳头和孢子自卫。 Toadoid - It looks like a knee-high mushroom which cap can be all blue, red, green, yellow, purple, yet the dots are always white, but it is actually a half sentient being. Cave dwelling. When exposed to fire or starlight it sometimes comes up out of the ground and sprouts a pair of feet. Otherwise it will simply live out its life in the spot the spores landed that spawned it. It has two arms and is able to wield weapons, but normally uses fists and spores to defend itself."
7	"云族——发现于气元素位面，这些元素生物基本上看起来像小团蓬松的云朵。它们是友好且情感丰富的生物，不介意载着外来者飞行。能够施放“阵风”法术，但年长的云族能施展更强大的与天空天气相关的法术。 Cloud Folk - Found in the Plane of Air, these elementals basically look like little puff clouds. They are friendly and emotionally driven creatures that don't mind giving rides to outsiders. Can cast Gust of Wind, but elder Cloud Folk are capable of much stronger sky weather related spells."
8	"甜鱼——微小的盲鱼，闪烁着蓝绿色的荧光。它们只生活在新鲜、未受污染的水中。若你看到它们那令人安心的光芒，便知这池水或小溪可以安全饮用。 Sweetfish - Tiny blind fish that glitter with blue-green luminescence. They only live in fresh, uncontaminated water. If you see their reassuring glow, you know that the pool or rivulet is safe to drink."
9	"特鲁布尔 - 色彩鲜艳的小毛球。它们以植物和地城碎屑为食。作为一种防御机制，它们会发出一种大多数类人生物觉得悦耳的“噗噜-唧唧”声。如果从掠食者众多的地下环境中移出，它们指数级的繁殖速度可能会带来麻烦。 Trubble - Small balls of brightly colored fur. They eat vegetable matter and dungeon detritus. As a defence mechanism they make a puur-chirp sound that most humanoids find pleasing. If removed from the predator-rich underworld environment, their exponential breeding rate may cause trouble."
10	"剪刀虫——地表探险者如此称呼，地下居民则称其为“黑暗中的饥饿”。形似甲虫，大小如餐盘，拥有巨大的锯齿状颚。对人形生物无害，但对各类真菌有着贪婪的食欲。它们对毒素有抵抗力，每只虫在群体中能投射出直径5英尺的静默球体。 Scissor Bugs - Called this by overworld explorers, underworld denizens call them 'hunger in the dark'. Beetle-like, the size of dinner plates and with huge serrated mandibles. They are harmless to humanoids but have a voracious appetite for fungus of all kinds. They are resistant to poison and they project a sphere of silence 5 ft. in diameter for each beetle in the swarm."
11	"门扉气泡 - 出现在维度屏障薄弱区域，如通往其他世界的活跃传送门附近。门扉气泡是凭空出现的漂浮球体，随机膨胀、缩小并消失。一些智者推测，它们实际上是多维生物穿越或在我们有限宇宙中投射“影子”的瞬间显现。 Gate Bubbles - Appearing in areas where the dimensional barriers are weak, such as in the vicinity of an active portal to another world. Gate bubbles are floating spheres that appear out of nowhere, grow large, shrink and dissapear apparently at random. Some sages speculate that they are actually glimpses of multi-dimensional beings moving through or casting ’shadows’ on our limited universe."
12	"巴克斯——这些蝙蝠长期生活在地底深处，失去了许多蝙蝠的典型特征。它们完全无眼、苍白、几乎无毛，脚部极为短小，耳朵大得几乎环绕整个头部，嘴里布满细小的牙齿。它们以昆虫为食，不过有一种名为爬行巴克斯的变种，已进化成以地衣为食，并用笨拙的翅膀在石质表面上拖行。所有巴克斯都害怕巨大声响，往往一见到冒险者就迅速逃离。 Bax - Bats that have been in the deep downs of the underworld for so long that they've lost many of their distinguishing bat features. Completely eyeless, pale, mostly hairless, and bearing only the stubbiest of feet, their ears are so large as to completely ring their head, and their mouths are full of tiny teeth. They eat bugs, though a different species, Crawling Bax, have evolved to eat lichens, and pull themselves along on stony surfaces with their clumsy wings. All Bax are terrified of loud noises and tend to flee adventurers with great haste."
13	"地牢猫 - 一种仅在地牢中发现的特殊猫类，它们同样享受孤独与好奇。地牢猫会跟随冒险者并观察他们，但一旦被发现，便会消失在地牢的另一处。与普通猫一样无害，只想在观察人们时不被打扰。奇怪的是，它们通常不属于地牢的创造者，据推测可能是某种中立观察灵体，以我们能理解的形式存在。 Dungeon Cat - A special sort of cat found only in dungeons, it delights equal parts in solitude and curiosity. Dungeon Cats follow adventurers around and observe them, but should they be noticed, they disappear to another part of the dungeon. As dangerous as a regular cat, just wants to be left alone while watching people. Curiously, they don't tend to belong to the dungeon's creator, and are theorized to be something like neutral observer spirits taking a form we can understand."
14	"八足跳跳 - 小型陆栖章鱼。它们栖息在潮湿的地方，属于两栖生物，就像天花板、墙壁和其他能抓住的地方的青蛙。它们相当聪明，小群体常试图跳到冒险者身上，以快速到达新地方。 Octohops - Tiny, land-dwelling octopi. They hang around damp places, being amphibious, and are like the frogs of the ceilings. And walls. And other places they can grab. They're fairly clever, and small groups often try to hop on adventurers for a quick ride to new places."
15	"眼鸟 - 夜行性鸟类，具备单一防御适应特征：翅膀上的巨大眼斑。受威胁时，它们会鼓起鲜红的喉囊，发出低沉的咆哮声，并展开翅膀展示看似巨大黄色眼睛的斑纹。 Eye-Birds - Nocturnal birds with a single defensive adaptation: Massive eyespots on their wings. When threatened, they puff out a bright red throat pouch, which produces a deep growling sound, and spread their wings open to reveal spots that look like massive, yellow eyes."
16	"薄荷虫群——小型白色等足类生物，味道难闻。受到威胁时，它们会伸展身体，将触角触碰到尾部，露出盔甲间鲜艳的红色条纹，以此警告大多数捕食者其难以下咽的味道。 Peppermint Polies - Small white isopods that taste foul. When threatened, they stretch themselves out and touch their antennae to their rear, exposing bright red bands between their armour. This alerts most predators to their nasty taste."
17	"闪亮果冻 - 一种微小或小型的软泥生物，以苔藓和其他植物为食。在这凝胶状生物体内悬浮着硬化的小块，类似玻璃，即使在微弱的烛光下也能闪闪发光。有趣的是，它在魔法光源下不会闪烁。 Sparkling Jelly - A tiny or small-sized ooze that eats mosses and other plant matter. Suspended in the gelatinous creature are hardened, small, and somewhat glass-like pieces which sparkle greatly from even a dim candle. Interestingly, it doesn't sparkle from magical sources of light."
18	"笑骨 - 一种看似吓人实则非常友好（且极为罕见）的亡灵骷髅生物。它们由地牢中的骨头和金属碎片被无宿主躯体的妖精灵魂发现并组装而成。笑骨会很高兴与冒险者或探险家同行一段时间（只要旅伴愿意交换笑话和故事！） Laughing Bones - An undead skeletal creature which might seem spooky, but are actually quite friendly (and very rare). They come from bones, and metal debris in a dungeon being found and assembled by a fey spirit without a host body. A laughing bones will be glad to travel with an adventurer or explorer for a while (as long as the traveler is willing to exchange jokes and stories!)"
19	"烛蟹 - 一种小型火与土元素混合体，外形似由黑曜石和硫磺构成的螃蟹。它避开水，但会迅速爬向木屑、炭块、小片棉花或破布以进食（通过将其吞入火焰中）。有趣的是，它似乎知道燃烧某些物品会造成巨大破坏或痛苦，因此会拒绝食用这些物品。它不会烧毁衣物（除非像手套这样明显给予它的部分），不会烧毁建筑物内的家具，也不会烧毁植物类生物，除非出于自卫且为了生存不得不这么做。 Candle Crab - A small elemental hybrid of fire and earth that looks like a crab made from obsidian and brimstone. It avoids water, but will scuttle toward a wood chip, piece of charcoal, a small piece of cotton, or a rag to snack on (by engulfing it in flames). Interestingly, it seems to know that eating/burning some things can cause a lot of damage or pain, and it will refuse to consume such things. It will not burn clothing (unless a piece like a glove is very obviously given to it), it won't burn furniture in a building, and it won't burn plant creatures unless it's in self-defense and absolutely has to in order to survive."
20	"纸灵——长期休眠的魔法书籍碎片和页面，部分获得了意识。这些小小战士渴望冒险与荣耀。它们通常只出现在古老图书馆、藏有法术书的年代久远宝库或其他魔法文献中。它们像老鼠或虫子等小型入侵者一样，挖掘出许多藏身之处。这些空间往往像任何智慧人形生物的住所一样舒适且富有创意地装饰。对纸灵来说，即使是一个小瓶盖和带有软垫的小饰品，也是舒适的桌椅。 Paper-kin - Scraps and pages of magical books left dormant for so long that parts of them gained sentience. These tiny little warriors thirst for adventure and nobility. They tend to only be found in ancient libraries, very old treasure hoards with spellbooks, or from other magical literary artifacts. They often tunnel out many hiding spaces like other diminutive intruders such as rats or bugs might do. These spaces tend to be as cozy and innovatively decorated as any intelligent humanoids dwelling might be. To a Paper-kin, even a small bottle cap and a trinket with some plush on it are a comfortable table and chair."
21	"粘液蠕虫——这些相对较大的蛴螬状生物在黑暗中发出微弱的绿光。它们的皮肤覆盖着一层粘液，吸引着昆虫和小虫。虽无害，但不小心碰到墙壁或愚蠢到去抓它们的冒险者会感到不适，因为要费力地将其撕下。“就像撕创可贴一样，快速撕掉它！” Sticky Worms - These are relatively large, grublike creatures that glow faintly green in the dark. Their skin is coated with a sticky mucus that insects and bugs seems to be attracted too. Harmless, but unpleasant to peel one off of the unwary adventurer who brushes against the wall or is silly enough to grab one. 'Just rip it off real quick, like a bandaid!'"
22	"低语蠕虫——它们是与蚯蚓大小相仿的史莱姆，擅长发出类似人低语的声音，但一旦受到干扰或威胁就会躲藏起来并保持沉默。 Whisper Worms - They're earthworm-sized slimes that have a knack for making noises that sound like people whispering, but hide and go silent whenever disturbed or threatened."
23	"鬼火甲虫——严格来说属于不死生物，这些甲虫无害且通常无形，看起来像萤火虫，但带有邪恶的红光或蓝光。它们在不死生物聚集的黑暗处形成交配群，大群的出现可能预示着强大的负能量涌动。它们可以被捕获并用于各种用途，但在阳光下会死亡。 Ghostfire Beetles - Technically undead, these beetles are harmless and usually incorporeal and appear like fireflies, but with a sinister red or blue glow. They congregate in mating swarms in darkness wherever undead are likely to amass, and a large swarm may indicate the presence of powerful negative energy swells. They can be captured, and used for various purposes, but die in sunlight."
24	"漂浮粘液——这些粘液孢子充斥着带有恶臭的微小气泡，内含氢气、甲烷和有毒气体，虽然易燃，但由于体积极小，对成人无害。需要大量聚集才能对个体构成威胁。它们倾向于在物体表面覆盖一层滑腻的酸性物质，可能刺激伤口或延缓愈合。少量盐水和小苏打即可迅速中和其酸性。 Floating Slimes - These slime-spores fill the air with tiny bubbles of foulness, being filled with hydrogen, methane, and mephitic vapors, they are flammable, but of so small volume they are harmless. It would take quite a large gathering of them to be any sort of danger to a grown individual. They do have a tendency to coat things with a layer of slick acid, and can irritate or slow the healing of wounds. A small application of saltwater and soda will quickly neutralize thier acid."
25	"火苔甲虫——一种细腻柔软的橙红色丝状地衣，在某种本地甲虫背上于无光处缓慢生长。它自然散发出微弱的紫外线光芒，但遇热或火焰时会迅速燃烧，释放少量热量和可见光（但大量紫外线，相当于几分钟内暴露在数小时的阳光下）。若精心采集、干燥并研磨成粉，可替代或作为黑火药的成分，或作为对抗避光生物的闪光武器。除了它们寄生的甲虫外，大多数生物因接触后不可避免的晒伤而学会避开这种地衣。 Fire-Moss Beetles - A fine downy sort of red orange filligree lichen that slowly grows in lightless places atop a certain variety of native beetle. It produces a sort of faint ultraviolet glow naturally, but when exposed to heat or flame burns quickly releasing a small amount of heat and visible light (but a great deal of ultraviolet light, the equivalent of several hours in full sunlight in only a minute). If painstakingly collected, dried, and powdered, it could be a substitute or ingredient for use in black-powder, or as some sort of flash weapon against creatures that avoid bright light. Most creatures, except the beetles they grow on, learn to avoid the lichen from the sunburns it inevitably gives when they brush up against it."
26	"水坑果冻 - 一种生活在潮湿处的小型史莱姆，常模仿小水坑以躲避大型捕食者。完全无害，它们以发霉环境中的细菌为食。据说味道相当不错，精灵文化中会生吃它们；称其有轻微的刺痛感和淡淡的坚果味。 Puddle Jelly - A small slime that resides in damp places, and often imitates small puddles of water to disguise themselves from larger predators. Completely harmless, they feed on the bacteria that cultures within the musty environments where they are found. Apparently they taste quite good, and elven cultures are known to eat them alive; they say it has a nice tingling sensation and has a slight nutty taste."
27	"房间光蝠——一种悬浮在地面上方的小兽，会滑向它感知到的食物所在之处。小生物常通过在前方投掷诱饵来骑乘它们。它们性情非常温顺。 Room-Ray - A little beast that hovers over the ground, gliding wherever it senses food. Small creatures often ride them by throwing bait ahead of them. They are very docile."
28	"信心小虫——一种大型螨类生物，能攀爬墙壁和天花板。它能消除周围人的焦虑，相当于对5英尺内的生物施放英雄气概。有时被用来缓解抑郁，并作为对它们上瘾者的筹码。 Confidence Critter - A large mite like creature that scales walls and roof. It eats away the anxiety of people around it, doing the equivalent of casting heroism to a creature within 5 ft. Sometimes kept used to alleviate depression, and used as leverage to people addicted to them."
29	"臭气之友——来自气元素位面的无害元素生物。这是一种散发恶臭的生物，出于未知原因会喜欢上一位玩家角色并跟随他们1d20分钟。任何在10英尺范围内的人都能闻到这股臭味。有些臭气之友是可见的，但那些看不见的尤其难闻。 Stench-Friend - A harmless elemental from the air plane. It is a foul smelling creature that for unknown reasons takes a liking to one PC and stays with them for 1d20 minutes. Anyone within 10 feet can smell the stench. Some are visible, but the ones that aren't smell especially bad."
30	"地下鸡 - 深色、虹彩色的鸡，头部极度萎缩，喙部被肉管取代，用于吸食地面上的地衣、霉菌、粘液等。它们没有视力，以3d4只的群体四处游荡。玩家角色首先可能听到它们在地面上吸食的声音。若受惊，它们会盲目地四处乱窜，随机撞上玩家角色、墙壁，甚至陷入危险。玩家角色可进行动物驯养检定来驱赶它们。 Under-Chickens - Dark, iridescent colored chickens that have very atrophied heads with fleshy tubes instead of beaks that suck at lichen, molds, slimes etc. on the ground. They have no sight and run around in flocks of 3d4. PCs encountering them might first hear them suck-pecking at the floor. If startled they'll run mindlessly and blindly in all directions randomly bumping into PCs, walls, or even into danger. PCs can make animal handling checks to herd them."
31	"受惊的骷髅 - 一具被魔法附魔，对任何冒险者都感到恐惧的骷髅。每当它注意到任何非亡灵生物时，就会表现得像是永久处于恐惧效果之下。它会尽其所能逃离任何事物，无法接近它们。此外，由于恐惧，它无法进行攻击。 The Scared Skeleton - A skeleton that has been magically enchanted to fear any adventurers. It will act as though a permanent fear effect is on it whenever it notices any non-undead being. It will run away from anything to the best of it's ability and can't approach them. Additionally, it cannot attack due to its fear."
32	"熊地精虱——每只如手指大小的跳蚤状生物。它们仅以熊地精的毛发（以及其中缠结的污垢和血液）为食。对大多数生物完全无害，但极具领地意识，会向任何靠近它们的物体威胁性地扭动。当附近没有熊地精或它们被从宿主身上移除时，它们会进入冬眠茧，但一旦听到足够大的噪音（如熊地精的咆哮或冒险队伍的动静），便会苏醒。虽然它们无法伤害玩家，但如果饥饿难耐，可能会尝试食用其他人形生物的毛发，被其“受害者”描述为轻微烦人。最常见于地精营地附近，但由于地精的广泛探索，它们以冬眠状态遍布世界各地。 Bugbear-Mites - Flea-like creatures about the size of a finger each. They feast only on bugbear hairs (and the dirt/blood matted into them). Entirely harmless to most creatures, they are very territorial and will wiggle menacingly at anything that gets near them. When no bugbears are near, or when they are removed from their host, they enter hibernation cocoons, but emerge whenever they hear a loud enough noise (such as a bugbear roar or a party of adventures). While they cannot harm players, they may attempt to consume the hair of other humanoids if hungry enough, something described as mildly annoying by their 'victims'. Most often found near goblin camps, though due to how far goblins explore, they are present in hibernation all over the world."
33	"孤独者——极其可爱的生物，寻找僻静的洞穴、废弃的城堡或其他鲜有生物造访的地方。它们小巧、可爱、毛茸茸且能飞翔。每位冒险者梦想中的随机收养对象。但有一点例外：孤独者憎恶其他生物。它们总是试图避开被看见，一旦被发现便会尝试逃跑。若被困或捕获，它们会爆裂成一阵绒毛，看似消失。实际上，它们要么传送，要么化作气态飘走，安然无恙。这无疑会让任何试图收养所见可爱之物的队伍感到沮丧。 The Solitars - Extremely cute creatures that seek out secluded caves, abandoned castles, or anything else rarely visited by other creatures. They are small, cute, fluffy and can fly. Every adventurers dream random adoption. Except for one thing. The Solitar hates any other creature. It will always attempt to avoid being seen, and when seen will attempt to flee. If trapped/captured, they will explode into a puff of fluff, seemingly disappearing. In reality, they either teleport or turn into a gaseous form and float away, safely. Sure to upset any party that tries to adopt every cute thing they find."
34	"洞穴眼——这些令人毛骨悚然却无害的生物栖息在黑暗的洞穴中。它们有点像透明的海星，但中心有一个高尔夫球大小的单眼。这只眼睛用于探测它们常见的捕食者，如巨型蝙蝠或史莱姆。它们通常只吃洞穴顶部和墙壁上的苔藓及其他腐烂植物物质。它们通常以3到10只的小群体生活。洞穴眼的直径很少超过30厘米。 Cave-eye - These creepy yet harmless creatures dwell in dark caves and caverns. They somewhat resemble transparent sea stars save for a golf ball sized singular eye on their centers. The eye is used to detect their common predators such as the giant bats or slimes. They usually only eat moss and other decaying plant matter found in cave roofs and walls. They usually live in small colonies of 3-10 creatures. Cave-eyes rarely grow to be more than 30 cm in diameter."
35	"晶族——这些晶体生长在具有强大魔法气息的地牢中。对于不了解的人来说，它们似乎只是普通的紫色晶体。然而，这些晶体是完全有感知的生物。它们能够与拥有心灵感应能力或与大地或石头有内在联系的生物（如矮人、土元素或其他晶族）交流。每个晶族都连接到一个心灵感应网络，随着时间的推移，这个网络会遍布整个地牢。如果没有采取适当的安全措施将晶族从其原始生长地（从而脱离其网络）移除，会导致其死亡并化为无价值的石粉。 Shardians - These crystals grow in dungeons with potent magical auras. To unknowledgeable they seem to be just ordinary purple crystals. However, these crystals are fully sentient creatures. They capable of communicating with creatures that possess either telepathic abilities or an innate connection to earth or stone (such as dwarfs, earth elementals, or other Shardians). Each Shardian is connected to a telepathic network that over time spreads throughout the whole dungeon. Removing a Shardian from it's original growing spot (and thus from its network) without proper safety measures causes it to die and crumble into worthless rock dust."
36	"巨型球潮虫 - 巨型鼠妇，长度可达12英寸。主要为食腐动物，以植物和死去的动物为食。受到威胁时会卷曲成装甲球状。 Giant Roly-Polies - Giant version of a pill bug, growing up to 12 inches in length. Primarily scavengers, feeding on plants and dead animals. When threatened it rolls itself into an armored ball."
37	"纸虫——一种与叶䗛相关的昆虫，已适应模仿羊皮纸而非树叶。作为昆虫体型较大，约一张羊皮纸大小，当它们站起来行走时颇为惊人，但除非你是本书，否则完全无害。它们主要以纸张和书籍胶水为食，常见于废弃的图书馆和书房。 Paper Bugs - a species of insect related to walking leaves, that have adapted to imitate sheets of parchment instead. Very big for bugs, about the size of a sheet of parchment, and startling when they stand up and start walking, but completely harmless unless you're a book. They mostly eat paper and book glue, and can be typically found in abandoned libraries and studies."
38	"锥头怪 - 体型如小狗般大小，这些生物用其灰色的尖状真菌帽模仿尖刺，当它们蹲下时，真菌帽从头延伸覆盖全身。它们的身体质地和颜色模仿所处地形，但一旦真菌帽被移除，其结构却诡异般地酷似哥布林。 Coneheads - Sitting at the size of a small dog, these creatures imitate spikes with their gray pointed fungi caps that extend off the head and cover the whole body when they crouch down. Their bodies texture and color imitate that of the terrain they’re in, though their structure eerily mirrors that of goblins once the fungi cap is removed."
39	"秃鹫史莱姆 - 如其名，这些史莱姆会跟随冒险者或地下世界的其他居民。它们以尸体和装备为食，随着时间的推移，会吸收所食之物的特性。高级别的史莱姆甚至能施展法术或使用职业能力，如果它们曾吞噬过强大的生物。它们的外表常因吞食武器和盔甲而呈现出皮革或金属质感。尽管难以消灭，它们却非常被动且无攻击性。偶尔，更聪明的史莱姆会试图引导地表居民进入陷阱，或安全带领他们穿越地牢，以便享用访客所杀之物。 Vulture Slimes - Like their namesake above, these slimes will follow around Adventurers or other denizens of the underground. They feed off corpses and equipment. Overtime they come to take on aspects of what they eat. Higher level ones can even cast spells or use class features if they were able to eat a strong creature. They often have leather or metallic outer coats from eating weapons and armor. Despite being hard to kill they are very passive and non hostile. Occasionally smarter ones will try to lead surface dwellers into traps or even lead them safely through the dungeon so they can eat whatever the visitors kill."
40	"毯子幽灵——与名字相反，毯子幽灵是一种以任何形式毯子出现的小精灵。它静候着，等待任何有感知的生物将其据为己有。但幸运的是，毯子幽灵对主人并无恶意，事实上恰恰相反。那些拥有毯子幽灵的冒险者会发现日常琐事莫名完成，夜晚安睡，还有一个他们直到失去才意识到的贴心伴侣。 Blanket Ghost - Contrary to its name, a blanket ghost is a fey spirit in the form of a blanket of any kind. It lies in wait, waiting for any sentient being to claim it as its own. But, luckily for all, the blanket ghosts do not have any form of ill-will toward their owners, in fact, quite the opposite. Those adventurers with a blanket ghost find simple chores done without any explanation why or how, a good night's rest and a loving companion that they don't even realise they have until it's gone."
41	"火炬蝇巢穴——这些锥形巢穴遍布世界各地的地牢墙壁上。在巢穴的宽口端，成群的黑色小蝇不断向上飞升，闪烁着生物发光的红橙色光芒，作为对捕食者的持续警告，并为它们栖息的黑暗洞穴提供便利的光源。据说，这些巢穴窄端的胶状物可以提炼成一种药水，让饮用者在黑暗中如同白昼般视物，或者制成一种毒药，使受害者因极度恐惧溺水而拒绝饮水。 Torchfly Nests - These cone-shaped nests can be found affixed to walls in dungeons the world over. At the wide end of the nest, swarms of the small black flies soar endlessly upwards, flashing bio-luminescent red and orange glows as an ongoing warning to predators and casting a convenient glow in the dark caves to which they are native. It is said that the jelly at the narrow end of these nests can be refined into a potion which lets the drinker see in the dark as if it were daylight, or into a poison which causes the victim to be so terrified of drowning they will refuse to even drink water."
42	"麋菇——一种四足真菌，外形大致似麋鹿，大小如小狗。秋季孢子成熟时，其“头部”区域会长出鹿角状的子实体。这些子实体在沙拉中极为美味，深受当地厨师追捧，但麋菇行动敏捷，对穿刺伤害有抵抗力，极难捕捉。 Elkshrooms - A four-legged fungus in a generally elkish shape, about the size of a small dog. They sprout antler-shaped fruiting bodies in the 'head' region when they sporulate in the fall. The fruiting bodies are delicious in salads, and highly coveted by local chefs, but elkshrooms are very quick, resistant to piercing damage, and hard to catch."
43	"位移蚊 - 看似普通的蚊子。当你试图拍打它们时，它们实际上会在左边六英寸处。 Displacer Mosquitoes - Seemingly normal mosquitoes. When you attempt to slap them, they are actually six inches to the left."
44	"嘲弄蛙 - 一种粉红色的小青蛙，其呱呱声对每个人听起来都像是不同的侮辱。 Mockingfrog - A small pinkish frog that has a croak that sounds like a different insult to each person."
45	"耳语蟋蟀——这些昆虫发出传统的鸣叫声，但当受到威胁时，它们会在威胁者身后制造出轻微的耳语或咆哮的听觉幻象。 Whisper Crickets - These insects make the traditional chirping noise, but when they are threatened, they create a minor aural illusion of whispering or growling behind the threat."
46	"微风小鱼——生活在空气中而非水中的小鱼。它们以小型昆虫为食，因此普遍受到喜爱。 Breeze Minnows - Small fish that live in the air instead of the water. They eat small bugs, and are generally well-liked because of it."
47	"狂欢蟹 - 当这些螃蟹聚集在一起时，会跳舞并用它们的钳子和壳制造音乐。 Rave Crabs - Crabs that when gathered in groups, will dance and use their claws and shell to create music."
48	"哨声鼠 - 非常害羞，喜欢躲藏。每当你不慎靠近一只（或多只）时，它们会发出震耳欲聋的哨声。这必然会破坏潜行或突袭。 Whistle Rats - Very shy, and like to stay hidden. Any time you inadvertently draw near to one (or more), they emit a deafeningly loud whistling noise. This will inevitably ruin covert movement / attacks."
49	"蓝头发光鸟 - 一种外表普通的鸟，能在黑暗中使巢穴发光以吸引昆虫。在交配季节，雄鸟会建造非常精致的附加结构，以制造多彩的照明来吸引雌鸟。 Glowing Bluehead - A plain-looking bird, that can make it's nest glow in dark to attract insects. During mating season, males build very elaborate additional constructions to make colorful illumination to attract females."
50	"厄运蟾蜍——这只肥胖、行动缓慢的蟾蜍有着令人不安的习惯，总是莫名其妙地出现在小径中央、你的背包上或其他不便之处。它似乎没有天敌，打扰它被认为会带来极坏的运气。如果它挡了你的路，你必须等待它自行离开，否则可能会被它那奇特的蟾蜍方式诅咒。 Toad of Ill Omen - This fat, slow moving toad has an unnerving habit of appearing seemingly out of nowhere, usually in the middle of a trail, on your pack, or other inconvenient location. It seems the toad has no natural predators, and it is considered extremely bad luck to disturb the toad. If it's in your way, you have to wait for it to decide to leave on its own accord, lest you be cursed by its strange toady ways."
51	"奇虾——一种悬浮的奇虾类生物，被时间异常（时间魔法）吸引，并喜欢穿越时间的裂缝。 Anomalocaris - A hovering anomalocaridid that is attracted to temporal anomalies (time magic) and has a penchant for slipping through cracks in time."

53	"鹅卵石甲虫 - 一种体型较大的昆虫，能够收起众多腿脚，伪装成一块鹅卵石。冒险者在走廊行走时有时会踩到它们，脚下发出响亮的“咔嚓”声。 Cobblestone Beetle - A rather large insect that can retract its many legs to resemble a single piece of cobblestone. Adventurers sometimes step on them while walking down a hallway, causing a loud CRUNCH sound under their feet."
54	"宝石黄蜂 - 一种闪亮、色彩鲜艳的黄蜂，以宝石和其他珍贵材料为食。它们经常侵扰龙的宝藏，根据龙的不同，可能被视为害虫或宠物。 Jewel Wasp - A shiny, brightly colored wasp that eats gemstones and other precious materials. They frequently infest dragon hoards, where they might be considered pests or pets, depending on the dragon."
55	"鹈鹕花——一种形似猪笼草的植物生物，利用两片大叶子作为翅膀飞行，像鹈鹕一样捕猎小动物。 Pelican Flower - A plant creature that looks like a pitcher plant, but uses two large leaves as wings, flying around and hunting small animals in a manner similar to pelicans."
56	"警报水母——受到惊扰时会闪烁警告红色，常吸引大型捕食者来处理干扰。 Alarm Jellyfish - Jellyfish that flash a warning red color when disturbed, often attracting larger predators to deal with the disturbance."
57	"香薰蛞蝓 - 手掌大小的蛞蝓，长有短触须，可无害地折断用作香薰。这些蛞蝓还带有安抚光环，被某些宗教团体视为圣物。 Incense Slugs - Palm-sized slugs that grow short tentacles which can be harmlessly broken off and used as incense. The slugs also have a calming aura, and are viewed as holy by certain religious orders."
58	"刃爪皮伦——形似长貂、六足啮齿动物。前两足各具三指，其中两指末端生有长刃状利爪。这些利爪永不污损，几乎无法折断，其背部亦覆有相同材质的板甲。即便动物死亡，利爪被取下，此特性仍保持不变。 Bladed Peerens - Rodents that look like long ferrets with six legs. The two front legs have three fingers, two of which ending in long, blade-like claws. These claws never get dirty or dull, and are next to impossible to break. They also have this same material as plates on their backs. These claws maintain this property if the animal dies and they are removed."
59	"治愈蟾蜍——红色蟾蜍，对食物特别贪婪且凶猛。由于它们能迅速自愈和重组，极难被杀死。若能捕捉并杀死一只，其血液可用于治疗。传说中，它们的血液甚至能用于再生肢体。 Healing Toads - Red toads that are particularly hungry and vicious for food. They are very hard to kill because they heal and reform so quickly. Their blood can be used for healing, if you can manage to catch and kill one. Legends also say that their blood has been used to regrow body parts."
60	"收割者格鲁姆——形似浣熊的圆胖哺乳动物，但毛皮上没有斑纹。它们只在野外的大型巢穴中被发现，几乎总是在睡觉。尽管从未离开巢穴，巢穴内却总是堆满食物。 Harvester Grums - Chubby mammals that look similar to raccoons, without the markings on their coats. The have only been found in the wild in large dens that they build; and are almost always sleeping. Despite never leaving their dens, the dens are always full of food."
61	"幻影飞虫 - 一种看似蜻蜓的透明昆虫。它们如同幻影：无法被触碰，也无法察觉周围的动物。它们仍会落在岩石和墙壁等固体物体上。 Illusory Flies - A see-through insect that looks like a dragonfly. They seem like an illusion: They cannot be touched and cannot see or hear any animals around them. They still land on solid objects like rocks and walls."

63	"膨膨虫 - 体型约如一条面包的毛虫。独特之处在于化蛹时，茧中会飞出数百只正常大小、鲜艳的绿蝴蝶。 Pufferbugs - Caterpillars roughly the size of a loaf of bread. Uniquely when they pupate, the cocoon produces hundreds of regular sized, vibrant green butterflies."
64	"水晶螨 - 一种来自幽暗地域的小型晶体昆虫，利用其宝石般的外表躲避捕食者；它们对宝石矿脉的自然吸引力使许多矿工将其作为宠物饲养；构成它们外骨骼的脆弱晶体毫无价值，但狡猾的幽暗地域商人可能会试图将其当作真宝石出售。 Crystal Mite - A small, crystalline insect from the Underdark that uses their gem-like appearance to hide from predators; their natural attraction to gem deposits leads many miners to keep the mites as pets; the fragile crystals that form their exoskeleton are worthless, but conniving Underdark traders may try to sell them as the real thing."
65	"黄油蝾螈——一种长约六英寸的小型淡黄色两栖动物，以其圆润可爱的外表和自然散发的奶油香气而闻名。这种生物以遇到的任何（死去的）生物的脂肪为食，只有在闻到腐烂肉体的气味时，才会从它称之为家的腐朽原木中现身。它没有攻击能力，且不食活物。因其形似黄油棒而得名，单独一只黄油蝾螈在地牢中的发现可谓可爱——直到人们发现它们成群结队地撕扯附近死去的生物残骸。 The Butternewt - A small, pale, yellow-ish amphibian some six inches long, the butternewt is known for its chubby, endearing exterior, and the creamy scent it naturally exudes. This creature consumes the fats of any (dead) creature it comes across, only emerging from the rotting logs it calls home when it smells dying flesh. It has no offensive capabilities, and is not known to consume living organisms. So named for its resemblance to a stick of butter, a single butternewt is an adorable discovery one might make in a dungeon — until they come across a number of them tearing into the remains of a dead creature nearby."
66	"基维·马萨尔 - 类似蜗牛的生物，利用找到的容器作为外壳。（例如罐子、箱子和一侧裂开的小木箱。）如果外壳破裂，它们的移动速度会比普通蜗牛快得多。它们可食用，味道像葡萄。它们的黏液和痕迹高度易燃。它们是草食性动物，偏爱霍金草。 Kivve Masal - Snail-like creatures which use containers they find as shells. (Examples include pots, chests, and Small crates with one side cracked open.) If their shell breaks, they will move much quicker than any snail would normally. They are edible and taste like grapes. Their mucus and trails are highly flammable. They are herbivores and favour haurchints."
67	"帽怪——类似披风怪，但体型较小。它们会落在某人的头上，将自己变成一顶时尚的头饰，并吃掉在头发中发现的虫子，同时发出类似鹦鹉学舌的啾啾声。 Cappers - Like cloakers, but small. They fall onto someone's head, arrange themselves into a fashionable piece of headwear, and eat the bugs they find in the person's hair while chirping in a way that sounds almost like spoken words (similar to a parrot)."
68	"嗡嗡蚊蝠 - 一枚硬币大小的蚊蝠，通过饮用泪水而非吸血来获取营养。为了获取食物，会向生物眼中投掷沙子、花粉或灰尘。 Humming Stirge - A coin-sized stirge that obtain nutrition through drinking tears instead of their blood-sucking brethren. Will throw sand, pollen, or dust in the eyes of creatures to get a meal."
69	"洞穴奔跑藤蔓——这些无叶植物的质地和粗细各异，从纤细如发丝到粗大如树干。它们与洞穴细菌存在化能合成关系，因此无需光照或叶片。然而，它们的嫩芽对食物链至关重要。 Cave Runner Vines - These leafless plants vary in consistency and thickness from delicate hairlike structures to huge woody ones as big around as tree trunks. They have a chemosynthetic relationship with cave bacteria meaning they need no light or leaves. Their young shoots, however, are vital to the food chain."
70	"敲击蝙蝠——无翼蝙蝠，四肢缺乏翼膜。它们通过敲击长指发出声音进行回声定位。 Tap Bats - Flightless bats whose limbs lack wing membranes. They echolocate by tapping their long fingers to make a sound."
71	"木蛀虫 - 这种3厘米长的黑色食木甲虫有时会将合成鞋底误认为树木，并会从鞋底钻入穿鞋者的脚部。如果被摇晃，它可能会困惑并尝试咬脚，但通常它只会将鞋底钻满小孔，直到鞋底在穿鞋者脚上碎裂。 Wood Borer - This 3cm, black, wood-eating beetle sometimes mistakes synthetic shoe soles for tree wood and burrows up through the sole of a person's shoe to their foot. If shaken up, it might get confused and take a test bite of the foot, but usually, it will just riddle the sole with holes until it disintegrates on the foot of the person wearing the infested shoe."
72	"凶暴鼹鼠——一种被动生物，以大型昆虫和凶暴蠕虫为食。体型与猪相当。对人形生物友好。 Dire Mole - A passive creature that hunts large bugs and dire worms. About as big as a pig. Friendly to humanoids."
73	"锈虫——小型黑色球状马陆，拥有闪亮的黑色外壳，由多个节段组成，使它们能够卷成近乎完美的球体以防御。群体可形成数英尺宽的覆盖层，但野外个体从不超过几毫米。这些锈蚀怪的远亲能够吞噬铁锈，留下清洁但受损的金属，但更偏好过滤死气。它们常在地底深处的凹陷或坑洞中形成覆盖层，那里积聚着无法呼吸的废气。聪明的炼金术士发现，这些小虫实际上能过滤死气并吐出纯氧。他们还发现，在人工饲养下，单独置于足够大的废气罐中，有充足空间活动，数月后它们能长至近一米长。其壳状节段可被采集，硬度足以替代钢铁。 Rust Bugs - Small black Roly-Poly millipedes with shiny black shells consisting of several segments that allow them to roll into a near-perfect sphere for defence. Swarms can form blankets several feet wide, but individuals are never bigger than a few milometers in the wild. These distant cousins of rust monsters can eat rust, leaving behind cleaned but damaged metal, but prefer to filter dead air. They can be found in blankets along the ground in deep dips or pits in the deep Underdark where pockets of unbreathable used air settles. Clever Alchemists have found these little bugs actually filter the dead air and spit out pure oxygen. They also discovered in captivity, kept alone, in very large tanks of used air with enough space to exercise, they can grow to nearly a meter in length after several months. The shell-like segments can be harvested and are hard enough to be used as a steel replacement."
74	"石甲虫 - 形似瓢虫，但灰色取代了红色，大小如拇指。它们像蚂蚁一样群居，并能啃食石头，对石头的种类极为挑剔。无害且畏光。 Stone Beetles - They look like ladybugs but they're grey where ladybugs are red, and they're thumbnail-sized. They chew through stone and form colonies much like ants. They're very picky about the sort of stone they like to chew. Harmless and photophobic."
75	"园丁蜘蛛 - 一种体型约如家猫的蜘蛛，利用其天然的织网能力进行园艺而非设陷阱，这种杂食性物种维护着广阔的地下花园。这些大型花园通常由幽暗地域的本土植物组成，但园丁蜘蛛对非本土物种也表现出极大兴趣。 Gardener Spider - A species of spider(roughly the size of a housecat) that uses its natural web making abilities in horticulture rather than trap making, this omnivorous species maintains vast underground gardens. These large gardens are usually made up of plant life indigenous to the under dark, but Gardener Spiders take great interest in non-native species."
76	"维里斯鼠蜥——一种伪装成啮齿动物的小型爬行动物。它藏身于鼠群中，利用细密的变色鳞片如细毛般帮助其融入环境。其大脑广受追捧，因其头部的一个小器官能产生精神投影，迷惑周围的鼠类，使它们相信它是同类。它主要以鼠群中的幼崽及老弱病残为食。 Veris Rat - A small reptile that masquerades as a rodent. Hides within rat colonies, using fine colour-shifting scales like thin hairs to help it blend in. It is widely sought for its brain - a small organ in its head produces a mental projection that confuses the rodents around it, convincing them that it is a fellow rat. It feeds primarily on rat young and the old or injured in rat colonies."
77	"骷髅假面蛛 - 这种蜘蛛的背部令人不安地酷似头骨，个体间拥有不同类型的头骨（人类、矮人、塔巴契等）。它们主要以困在网中的昆虫为食，这些网也呈头骨形状，通常只伪装成头骨以躲避或吓退威胁。它们的背部被用作装饰品和初级死灵术的试剂，而它们的腿则为汤底增添了一抹独特的风味。 Stal Faux - This species of spider has a back that looks unnervingly similar to a skull, with individuals having different sorts of skulls (human, dwarf, tabaxi, etc.). They mostly feed on insects trapped in their webs, which are also shaped like skulls, and typically only disguise themselves as skulls to hide from or scare off threats. Their backs are used as decoration and as a reagent in novice necromancy, and their legs add a nice kick of flavour to soup broth."
78	"星辉真菌 - 一种独特的真菌，附着在大型洞穴的天花板上，排列成模仿头顶星空的图案，仿佛能透视数百米的岩石。尤其凶残的卓尔精灵会涂改它们，设计误导性的图案，试图诱骗那些愚蠢到用它们来导航的地底探险者。 Stellar Fungi - A unique breed of fungus that adheres to large caves' ceilings, organizing themselves to mimic the pattern of stars directly overhead, as if capable of seeing through hundreds of meters of stone. Particularly savage Drow paint them with misleading designs, trying to waylay Underdark explorers foolish enough to use them for navigation."
79	"哨音猫 - 失明的猫科动物，已发展出回声定位能力，能够模仿哨声和咔嗒声。它们利用这种能力使蝙蝠及类似生物落入精心布置的埋伏中。对智慧种族友好，可被收为魔宠或动物伙伴。 Whistle Cats - Blind felines that have developed echolocation abilities, capable of mimicking whistles and clicks. They use the ability to cause bats and similar creatures to fall into their carefully made ambushes. Friendly to sapient races, can be adopted as familiars and animal companions."
80	"诅咒甲虫——拳头大小的昆虫，这些生物以圣水和邪水为食，利用这些液体作为防御手段，抵御它们所栖息的洞穴中的生物。它们毫无意识，乐于与智慧种族亲近，是一种害虫，几乎没有食用价值。传统上出现在废弃的教堂和修道院中，很少成群结队，通常不超过五六只。当被激怒时，它们会泄漏刚刚摄入的圣水。 Damned Beetles - A fist-sized insect, these creatures are unique in their diet: they consume both holy and unholy water, using the liquid as a defence against the creatures of the dungeons it inhabits. Mindless and happy to cozy up with sapient races, they're a pest species with little value as food. Traditionally found in abandoned churches and monasteries, they're rarely in groups larger than five or six creatures. When agitated, they leak whatever sacred water they just ingested."
81	"洞穴兔——通常伪装成岩石，能够完全静止不动，以至于常被误认为石头。与地表兔子不同，它们具备一定的攀爬能力。与地表兔子相似，快速繁殖是其生存的主要策略。 Cave Rabbits - Generally camouflaged top the rock and able to stand absolutely still, to the point that they can be mistaken for rocks. Unlike surface rabbits, they have some climbing ability. Like surface rabbits, rapid breeding is a major component of their survival."
82	"架状真菌 - 大型真菌生长体，从空气中过滤养分。缓慢生长，形成稳固且相当坚固的架状结构。边缘的尖刺会在生物攀爬时造成轻微刮伤，并吸收由此获得的血液中的养分。 Shelf Fungus - Large fungal growths that filter nutrients from the air. Grow slowly, forming solidly anchored, fairly sturdy shelves. Spines on edges cause minor scrapes on creatures using them to climb and absorb the nutrients from the resulting blood obtained."
83	"花精哥布林——一种草食性的类哥布林生物，体型约为普通哥布林的三分之二。它们是杂食性且机会主义的清道夫，以水果、害虫为生，偶尔也会吃食肉动物的剩食。它们的智力略高于普通动物，但无法学会说话，对语调而非特定声音反应更为敏感。在黑暗中，它们因相似的轮廓很容易被误认为是哥布林。 Florogoblin - A herbivorous goblinoid that is about two thirds the size of a goblin. They are omnivorous and opportunistic scavengers, living on fruits, vermin, and occasionally on carnivore's leavings. They are slightly more intelligent than the average animal, but cannot learn to speak, and react more to tone than particular sounds. In the dark, they could easily be mistaken for goblins due to their similar silhouettes."
84	"暗夜嗡嗡者——这些巨大的熊蜂直径约八到十英寸，身披橙色绒毛，带有黑色条纹。它们飞行时声音响亮，拥有可反复使用的大螫针（类似黄蜂）。与黄蜂一样，它们极具攻击性，会保护能转化为蜂蜜的糖分来源：花朵、果实以及腐烂的尸体。 Darkbumbler - These large bumblebees are roughly eight to ten inches in diameter, with orange fur with black stripes. They fly loudly and have large stingers which they can use repeatedly (similar to wasps). Like wasps, they are very aggressive and protect sources of sugar that they can convert to honey: flowers, fruit, and decomposing corpses."
85	"洞穴蟹 - 这些小螃蟹呈淡棕或奶油色。若被压碎，其血液会喷溅而出，覆盖在溅到的任何物体上，发出几乎无法洗掉的荧光黄绿色光芒。这种光芒会持续26至36小时。 Cave Crab - These small crabs are a pale tan or cream colour. If they are crushed, their blood spurts out, covering whatever they splatter on to in a glowing neon yellow-green light which is almost impossible to wash off. The glow persists for 26-36 hours."
86	"巨型蚕 - 因食用奇异蘑菇而异常长大的蚕。卓尔常用它们的丝制作毯子、衣物、旗帜、绳索及其他各种编织品。 Giant Silkworm - Silkworms that have grown unnaturally large due to the strange mushrooms they eat. Their silk is often used by Drow to craft blankets, clothing, banners, rope, and a variety of other woven items."
87	"巴拉巴拉——这些形似帽贝的生物覆盖着圆顶壳，大小约如手推车，用四条短粗的腿行走。遇到捕食者或可食用真菌时，它们会紧贴地面，使外壳与地面形成紧密密封。进食时，它们用粗糙的舌头刮去壳下地面的所有植被，随后继续移动。 Bara-Bara - These limpet-like creatures are covered with a domed shell, roughly the size of a wheelbarrow, and walk on four stumpy legs. When it encounters a predator or a patch of edible fungus, it drops to the ground, forming a tight seal between the ground and it's shell. To feed, it uses its rasping tongue to strip the ground of all vegetation beneath its shell, at which point it moves on."
88	"观者 - 灰白色、猫大小的生物，用四根细长、近乎人形的肢体爬行和攀爬。它们的头部略显棱角，向后弯曲成冠状，虽然看似无面，但头部前方实际上覆盖着许多细密、几乎看不见的裂缝。通过这些器官，它们吸收并从中获取光和魔力的养分。它们常单独或成对出现，尾随并凝视着使用光源（尤其是魔法光源）的旅行者或冒险队伍。 Lookers - Pale grey, cat-sized creatures that crawl and climb on four thin, long, nearly man-like limbs. Their heads are somewhat ridged and crested curving back, and although they appear faceless the front of their heads are in fact covered with a multitude of thin, nearly invisible slits. Through these organs, they absorb and derive sustenance from light and mana. They can often be seen alone or in pairs, following and gazing upon travellers or adventurer parties navigating with light (particularly of the magical variety)."
89	"暗影粘菌——这种黑色霉菌沿着潮湿的岩石表面缓慢生长。它只在阴影中生长，但也需要附近的光源来制造那些阴影。当受到干扰时，它会发出咯吱声并缩回其栖息的阴影深处。在此过程中，它还会以自身为中心触发一个黑暗术。 Shadow Slimemold - This dark mold slowly grows along the wet rock surfaces. It will only grow in the shadows, but also requires a nearby source of light to create those shadows. When disturbed, it will squelch and retract deeper into the darkness of the shadows it resides in. While doing so it also triggers a Darkness spell centred on itself."
90	"斯库格——这些肥硕的蟾蜍大如餐盘，通体黑色带有黄色疣粒。它们异常沉重，仿佛由钢铁铸成，常攀上岩架，跃下砸向小型猎物，以钝力创伤将其压死。其厚皮能抵御多数捕食者的撕咬，但并非全部。它们是杂食性生物。 Skugs - These fat toads are the size of dinner plates, black with yellow warts. They are unusually dense, as if they are made of steel, and often climb up to ledges and drop on to small prey below in order to crush them to death via blunt force trauma. Their thick hide can protect from many predators bites, though not all. They are Omnivorous."
91	"歌唱蛛网编织者——这种体型微小、蓝绿相间的大蜘蛛，其蛛丝能吸收路过生物和挣扎猎物振动产生的声波，随后释放出近乎音乐般的幽怨声波，迷惑蝙蝠飞入其陷阱。蛛网具有减震特性，对雷鸣和非魔法钝击伤害免疫，对魔法钝击伤害有抗性。蜘蛛自身由蛛网护甲保护，用此蛛丝编织的衣物能赋予穿戴者对非魔法钝击伤害和雷鸣伤害的抗性。 Sing Web Weaver - The threads of this large (tiny size category) blue and green spider's web absorb sound waves from the vibrations of passing creatures and struggling prey, which the webs then release as haunting, almost music-like sound waves that confuse bats into flying into their traps. The webbing is shock absorbant, and is immune to Thunder and Non-Magical Bludgeoning damage, and Resistant to Magical Bludgeoning, and the spiders are armoured with their webs, and clothes woven from the webbing confers resistance to Non-Magical Bludgeoning damage and Thunder damage."
92	"祖尔斯——这些蛞蝓的远亲能够钻入鹅卵石或岩石中，视其大小而定。它们能挤进最小的缝隙，利用压缩的肌肉在岩石中开辟道路。随后，它们用众多的吸盘和肌肉在石头内构建小型躯体。其中一些会长出四肢，另一些则能变成滚动的小生物。大多数祖尔斯性情平和，但某些物种形成的群落可能相当危险。它们能利用各种矿物，包括矿石和晶体，来发展自己的护甲。 Zurs - These distant cousins of slugs can dig into pebbles or rocks, depending on their sizes. They can squeeze into the smallest openings, and use their compacted muscles to carve a path in the rock. They can then use their multiple suckers and muscles to build small bodies into their stones. Some of them grow arms and legs, while others can become small creatures that roll. Most of them are peaceful, but some species develop colonies that can become quite dangerous. They can use any kinds of minerals, including ores and crystals, to develop their armor."
93	"深渊鳗鱼——这些生物看起来像是鳗鱼和七鳃鳗的混合体，但它们并不在水中游动。相反，它们体内有类似电鳗的发电器官，能够利用电力在空中漂浮。它们是小型捕食者，猎食依附在深渊壁上的微小生物，并能用电力从短距离内将其击晕。面对更大的生物时它们显得胆怯，但对能够驯服它们的施法者来说，它们会成为忠诚的魔宠。 Chasm Eels - these creatures look like a cross between an eel and a lamprey, though they do not swim in water. Rather, they have electric organs in their bodies, similar to electric eels, which they use to float in the air. They are small predators hunting tiny critters that cling to the walls of chasms and can use their electricity to stun them from a short distance. They are skittish around larger creatures, but make loyal familiars to spellcasters who can tame them."
94	"洞穴葡萄——以各种根状真菌结节为食的荧光甲虫幼虫。它们长到葡萄大小，腹部储存大量糖液，类似于地表上的蜜罐蚁。作为防御机制，它们会向攻击者喷射荧光粘液。它们可被采集，甚至驯化为食物来源。 Cave Grapes - Phosphorescent Beetle larvae that feed on a variety of root-like fungal nodules. They grow to be grape sized and store a large amount of sugary liquid in thier abdomens like honeypot ants on the surface. They squirt a phosphorescent goo on attackers as a defense mechanism. They can be foraged for, and even domestecated as a food source."
95	"泥沼罐——这些恶臭生物类似迷你版的罗珀，拥有能缠绕猎物的粘性触须，但它们的猎物通常是微小昆虫，偶尔也有小生物。它们桶状的身体中央有一个凹陷，储存着散发腐肉和粪便气味的恶臭液体，用以吸引猎物。它们拥有帽贝般的足部、一圈嘴巴，以及“碗”边缘极为敏感的触须状纤毛，赋予它们15英尺的盲视能力。它们通常在水源附近聚集成百上千的群落，通过出芽繁殖。 Sludgepots - These foul-smelling creatures resemble miniature ropers, in the sense that they have sticky tendrils that can ensnare prey, although their prey is typically tiny insects and occasionally small creatures. Their barrel-sized bodies feature a central depression which stores vile liquid which smells of rotting meat and feces, to attract their prey. They have a limpet-like foot, and a ring of mouths, and a very sensitive array of antenna-like cilia on the rim of their 'bowl' that gives them blind-sight to 15 feet. They typically gather in colonies of 100 or more near water sources, and reproduce by budding."
96	"暗色地毯——一种极黑的黏菌，拥有将空气转化为石头（或偶尔是矿物矿石）的魔法能力，尽管速度缓慢。平均每年增厚一英寸。这种霉菌以黑暗为食，偏好潮湿环境，若暴露于强光或高浓度含金矿石下会死亡。生成的石头通常与当地地质相匹配，但有时也能形成新的珍贵矿脉。若能破解黏菌决定生成何种石头的机制，便可拥有一座可再生的矿场。 Dark Carpet - A vanta-black colored slime-mold which has the magical ability to transmute air to stone (or rarely, mineral ores), albeit slowly. An inch thick per year, on average. The moss feeds on darkness, prefers damp conditions, and dies if exposed to bright light or high concentrations of gold-bearing ore. The stone created typically matches the geology of the local environment, but can sometimes create new veins of valuable ore. Were one to figure out what makes the slime determine what type of stone to place, one could have a regenerating ore-mine."
97	"酸土豆精 - 并非真正的植物，而是一种外来生命体，属于“慢速生命”，它们对时间的感知与普通生物和植物不同；这些锥形生命体通过缓慢旋转和推进，利用其六至十二英寸宽的主根末端的一颗坚硬牙齿，甚至能在坚硬的岩石中穿行。一颗土豆精从芽到成年需要15年，每年挖掘约1英尺。一旦扎根，它们会蔓延出藤蔓，形成木质、蜡质、充满淀粉的块茎状芽，这些芽可以收获、蒸煮和慢烤，然后捶打几分钟，制成一种美味且极具弹性的麻糬状糊状物。这种糊状物带有酸味，口感类似于混合了莳萝腌黄瓜汁和鱼酱的土豆泥；对于地表居民来说，这种味道组合或许不具吸引力，但许多地下居民却对此情有独钟。此外，土豆精在烹饪前可抗腐长达一年。 Sour Po'Tuber - Not actually a plant, but technically an outsider and a form of 'slow life' that experiences time differently than normal creatures and plants; these cone-shaped lifeforms burrow through even solid rock with a single, hard tooth on the end of their six to twelve-inch wide tap-root by slowly twisting and pushing forward. A single Po'Tuber takes 15 years to grow to adulthood from a bud, and digs at a rate of about 1 foot per year. Once established, they spread out runner-vines which form woody, waxy, starch-filled tuber-like buds which can be harvested, steamed and slow-roasted, and then pounded for several minutes into a tasty, very stretchy mochi-like paste. The paste is sour and tastes like mashed-potatoes with dill pickle juice and anchovy paste; to topsiders perhaps not a flavor combination that appeals, but many in the darklands relish the dish. Additionally, the po'tubers resist rot for up to a year until cooked."
98	"洞穴莲——一种独特的白色地衣，每天本能地施展舞光术，持续时间可达1小时。这些地衣成簇生长，多个植株共同维持法术，使其持续时间远超1小时。洞穴莲通过吸收附近植物的光合作用系统及分解它们获取养分来维持自身。其他需要光照的植物依赖于洞穴莲。通常，这些植物会以某种方式保护地衣，或提供其无法从其他途径获取的养分。洞穴莲的叶子形似巨大的莲叶（直径可达2米），带有类似莲花（略带鱼腥味）的香气，可食用；叶面呈乳白色，带有乳蓝色叶脉。叶子会自行缓慢卷曲和展开，形成极慢的舞蹈（持续数小时）。在洞穴莲生命周期的某个阶段，它会生长出乳蓝色的绒球，释放淡蓝色孢子；由一根滴落白色粘稠乳状汁液的茎支撑。这种汁液具有麻醉性，是一种强效的分离剂；若由训练有素的炼金师妥善采集，效果类似于氯胺酮。长期接触这种汁液的采集者偶尔会出现“语义记忆障碍，以及分离性和类精神分裂症状”。 Cavelotus - A distinctive white lichen that instinctively casts dancing lights for up to 1 hour per day. The lichens grow in large clumps of multiple plants, supporting the sustained cantrip for much longer than 1 hour, collectively. The lichen supports itself by tapping into both the photosynthesis system of nearby plants, as well as breaking them down for nutrients. Other plants requiring light are dependent upon the cavelotus. Often, these plants offer some form of protection to the lichen, or provide a nutrient that it can't get any other way. The cavelotus leaves resemble giant lotus leaves (up to 2 meters across), and have a similar perfumed (if fishy) flavor and are edible; but are creamy-white with milky blue veins. The leaves roll and unroll slowly by themselves, in a very slow dance (hours). At a point in the cavelotus's lifecycle, it sprouts milky-blue puffballs that release pale-blue spores; supported by a stalk that drips a white, sticky, milk-like sap. The sap is narcotic, and a powerful dissociative; somewhat like ketamine if properly collected by a trained alchemist. Chronic exposure to the sap occasionally caused collectors to display 'semantic memory impairment, and dissociative and schizotypal symptomatology'."
99	"影叶草 - 一种仅在黑暗中生长的植物，其苍白的白色叶子可作为多种施法材料的替代品。根部为淀粉质块茎，适合炖煮。但需小心，叶子若暴露于直射阳光或火光下，会燃起幽灵般的白色火焰，需一小时才能扑灭。 Shadowleaf - A plant that only grows in the dark, produces pale white leaves that are a viable substitute for various spell components.
